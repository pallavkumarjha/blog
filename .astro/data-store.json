My name is Pallav.\n\nI recently completed a two months long ride on west coast of India (Woop woop 🥳). This article and the coming few articles will be my diary entry for the past two months, so please treat it like one.\n\nI will try to be as descriptive as possible and if you have any comments, questions, doubts, complaints, appreciation or anything else, do leave a comment below or ping me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com).\n\nThis is the first article in a series about my journey. You can follow the series here:\n1. Initial Steps of My 2 Months Long Solo Bike Ride (Current)\n2. [Planning the West Coast Journey](/blog/planning-west-coast-journey)\n3. [Day 1: Beginning the Journey](/blog/day-1-beginning-the-journey)\n4. [Ride to the Starting Point: Madurai to Kanyakumari](/blog/ride-to-starting-point)\n\n## 1. The Genesis\n\nThe first thought of me going on a long bike ride occurred to me when I had to change cities (Noida to Bengaluru). I planned the entire route, where I would stop, which route to follow, what places to visit and what not.\n\nGuess what, the plan went down the drain because of third wave of covid. I had to take a flight and change cities. Next thing I know I got covid. After recovering from it, the only thing I wanted to do was get on my bike and ride to some place. I had never done long rides (+350km) in the past so I wanted to test my stamina.\n\n## 2. Testing the Waters\n\nI took my bike next weekend and went on a long ride. It was a tiring day but I was able to manage somewhere close to 420km.\n\nI had severe back pain, my whole body just wanted to rest. But damn what a ride it was.\n\nNext thing I know I was planning to go to Pondicherry, and figuring out where to stay, what to eat, what to see and other things.\n\nI had almost finalised everything and then I thought if I can do a week I can probably do a month, so why not plan for that. From there I started planning for this long ride.\n\n## 3. The Parent Challenge\n\nI knew that I could take on this challenge because I had some experience of solo budget traveling, so I had to address other challenges. First and foremost was getting permission from parents.\n\nI could handle my expenses, I could take care of myself, I could live by myself but getting the permission to do that was a tough task.\n\nHere are few things I kept in mind while solving this issue:\n\n### 1. Address My Parents' Concerns\n\nI need to understand if my parents are saying something, they have a reasonably good reason in their head on why they are saying it. I have to address it.\n\n### 2. Build Trust Through Action\n\nShow them, don't tell them. Action speaks louder than words. I went for a short trip, came back safely. Did the trip responsibly. Behaved like an adult. Shared my location with them, stayed in contact almost every time. Made them believe that I know what I am doing.\n\n### 3. Financial Independence\n\nThis goes without saying. I want to do a trip, I want to go on a bike ride, I want to do that trek, so it should be My money which should be spent.\n\n### 4. Embracing Adulthood\n\nI am an adult. My parents have to understand that, and I have to understand that. I have to be responsible for my decisions and cannot put it on my parents that they took this decision for me. Once my parents realise this, they would know how important this trip is to me.\n\n> \"You have to grow your parents.\"\n> \n> — A friend in Goa\n\nRead that line again.\n\n## 4. What's Next?\n\nIn the next article, I would write about how I actually planned this long ride in budget.\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

If you're unfamiliar with my background, I recommend checking out the previous article first.\n\n## Financial Planning\n\nAfter securing permission and ensuring I had a capable bike, the next step was financial planning. I calculated a daily budget of ₹1000, excluding fuel costs. Here's how I broke it down:\n\n- Accommodation: ₹500-₹600\n- Food: ₹300-₹400\n- Miscellaneous: ₹100-₹200\n\nI added a buffer of ₹200 per day for unexpected expenses. For the two-month journey, the total budget came to less than ₹1,00,000 including fuel costs.

Bengaluru (End)\n\nSince I needed to continue working during my journey, I planned most of my travel for weekends, particularly Sundays, with occasional weekday rides when necessary.\n\n## Preparation and Packing\n\nTo prepare for the journey, I:\n- Got my bike (Bosco) fully serviced\n- Invested in essential riding gear:\n  - New helmet\n  - Riding gloves\n  - Riding jacket\n  - Riding pants\n\nI'm a light traveler by nature, and motorcycle travel demands even more minimalism. I packed only the absolute essentials:\n\n- A rucksack containing:\n  - Clothes\n  - Shoes\n  - Slippers\n  - Raincoat\n- A laptop bag with:\n  - Laptop\n  - Chargers\n  - Extension cord\n  - Headphones\n\nAll luggage was secured to the bike using bungee cords, and with that, I was ready to begin my adventure.\n\nStay tuned for the next article where I'll share the experiences from day one of this incredible journey.\n\n---\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

Initial Fears\n\nInitially it was scary, I still remember I had second thoughts for this trip till the last moment.\n\nI am going alone, what if my bike's tyre gets punctured in the middle of nowhere, what if the engine oil leaks, what if someone scams me, what if I meet with an accident, what if I don't enjoy the trip, what if I meet bad people, blah blah and blah.\n\nMultiple negative thoughts rushed through my mind before starting the trip. Same thoughts occurred to me when I was on my first solo trek. I brushed them off then and I brushed them off this time as well. 🙌\n\n## 4. The Departure\n\nThe day I had planned to start my journey was 11 Feb, 2022. Everything was planned. The itinerary was made, my machine (motorcycle) was ready and I was excited.\n\nOn the planned day, I woke up at 3AM, got ready, checked all my things (luggage, motorcycle papers, first aid kit etc) one last time.\n\nI tied all the luggage on my bike and around. At 4 AM, I started.\n\nMy first destination was Madurai, around 450kms from Bengaluru. I had never covered these many kms in a single day, but I was confident that I could do it because the previous week, I went on a ride of about 400km to check my stamina and how my body reacts to it.\n\n## 5. On the Road\n\nThe moment I left my street and went on the main road, one of the fellow riders gave me a biker salute. I returned the gesture. This became a habit of mine for the entire ride, every time I saw a rider, I gave them a biker salute and most of them would return it as well.\n\nThe ride was going as planned and there were no hiccups. I purposefully wanted to avoid highways because crunching miles on highway was not the primary goal of this trip, it was to explore. Check out offbeat places and meet new people.\n\nIn one of the stretches where I got down from the highway and was going through a town, I was gathering stares from all the people around. Who is this fellow with a jacket, a riding pant, riding gloves and helmet, all in black, riding in this heat and smiling.\n\nMost of the people I met on traffic signals or on small stalls used to ask me this question\n\" Garmi nahi lagta tumko ? \" (Don't you feel hot ?)\nI said, I did but all this is necessary, the things I wear is not for comfortability but for protection when situation goes sideways.\n\n## 6. Meeting Vasu\n\nI stopped for brunch in of the small bakery shops. I was sitting on the chair and waiting for my samosa and medu vada to arrive, but before they could arrive, the cashier arrived.\n\nI looked up and he was asking me something in Tamil (native language of the state). I had no idea what he was speaking. I told him I cannot understand you with whatever means I could , using my hands, expression and words.\n\nHe understood and asked then the conversation followed like this:\n\nVasu: \"Where from?\"\nMe: \"Bengaluru.\"\n\nVasu: \"Where to?\"\nMe: \"Madurai.\"\n\nVasu: \"Why?\"\nMe: \"To see the place.\"\n\nVasu: \"On bike?\"\nMe: \"Yes.\"\n\nAfter I said I was traveling on bike, his jaw dropped. I am not sure what he thought of me after that answer of mine but he must have thought, either I am a madman or definitely I am a mad man. 😂\n\nWe both couldn't understand each other and no one was proficient in other's language but still we had a cheerful and long discussion.\n\nHe asked where I worked and after I said I worked for Walmart which is similar to what Flipkart does here in India, he asked me if I could give him a discount on TV that he wants to buy. I smiled and said i cannot as I do not work in that department.\n\nHis mentioned his name is Vasu and was married, he had a set of twins — one girl and a boy. He showed me their pictures and was very happy while showing it. I could sense the happiness. I asked him about his parents and he said, both of them passed away when he was a child, he was raised by his grandfather and grandmother. Now he works in a bakery as a cashier and is happy talking to me.\n\nWe had a chat for about half an hour. Before leaving I asked him I could take a picture with him and he obliged happily.\n\nHe dropped me to my bike while customers were waiting on the counter for him to come back. He invited me to his home as well, next time I am around that area. I said goodbye and started the ride again.\n\n## 7. The Final Stretch\n\nJust few kms before Madurai, I was a bit lost and wanted to know the directions when i saw a kid standing at a bus stop and waved at him with the hope that he may be able to help me. Even with his friend yelling to not come towards me as they may miss their bus, the kid came running towards me barefooted, (which i noticed later on) helped me out and ran back to the stop a few meters away to catch his bus.\n\nRest of the ride was scenic but uneventful. I passed though great landscape.\n\nI reached my hotel, checked in and just crashed on the bed.\n\nThis was a good day.

Initial Fears\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Initially it was scary, I still remember I had second thoughts for this trip till the last moment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I am going alone, what if my bike’s tyre gets punctured in the middle of nowhere, what if the engine oil leaks, what if someone scams me, what if I meet with an accident, what if I don’t enjoy the trip, what if I meet bad people, blah blah and blah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Multiple negative thoughts rushed through my mind before starting the trip. Same thoughts occurred to me when I was on my first solo trek. I brushed them off then and I brushed them off this time as well. 🙌\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"4-the-departure\">4. The Departure\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The day I had planned to start my journey was 11 Feb, 2022. Everything was planned. The itinerary was made, my machine (motorcycle) was ready and I was excited.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the planned day, I woke up at 3AM, got ready, checked all my things (luggage, motorcycle papers, first aid kit etc) one last time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I tied all the luggage on my bike and around. At 4 AM, I started.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My first destination was Madurai, around 450kms from Bengaluru. I had never covered these many kms in a single day, but I was confident that I could do it because the previous week, I went on a ride of about 400km to check my stamina and how my body reacts to it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"5-on-the-road\">5. On the Road\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The moment I left my street and went on the main road, one of the fellow riders gave me a biker salute. I returned the gesture. This became a habit of mine for the entire ride, every time I saw a rider, I gave them a biker salute and most of them would return it as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The ride was going as planned and there were no hiccups. I purposefully wanted to avoid highways because crunching miles on highway was not the primary goal of this trip, it was to explore. Check out offbeat places and meet new people.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In one of the stretches where I got down from the highway and was going through a town, I was gathering stares from all the people around. Who is this fellow with a jacket, a riding pant, riding gloves and helmet, all in black, riding in this heat and smiling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most of the people I met on traffic signals or on small stalls used to ask me this question\n” Garmi nahi lagta tumko ? ” (Don’t you feel hot ?)\nI said, I did but all this is necessary, the things I wear is not for comfortability but for protection when situation goes sideways.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"6-meeting-vasu\">6. Meeting Vasu\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I stopped for brunch in of the small bakery shops. I was sitting on the chair and waiting for my samosa and medu vada to arrive, but before they could arrive, the cashier arrived.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I looked up and he was asking me something in Tamil (native language of the state). I had no idea what he was speaking. I told him I cannot understand you with whatever means I could , using my hands, expression and words.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He understood and asked then the conversation followed like this:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Vasu: “Where from?”\nMe: “Bengaluru.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Vasu: “Where to?”\nMe: “Madurai.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Vasu: “Why?”\nMe: “To see the place.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Vasu: “On bike?”\nMe: “Yes.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After I said I was traveling on bike, his jaw dropped. I am not sure what he thought of me after that answer of mine but he must have thought, either I am a madman or definitely I am a mad man. 😂\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We both couldn’t understand each other and no one was proficient in other’s language but still we had a cheerful and long discussion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He asked where I worked and after I said I worked for Walmart which is similar to what Flipkart does here in India, he asked me if I could give him a discount on TV that he wants to buy. I smiled and said i cannot as I do not work in that department.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>His mentioned his name is Vasu and was married, he had a set of twins — one girl and a boy. He showed me their pictures and was very happy while showing it. I could sense the happiness. I asked him about his parents and he said, both of them passed away when he was a child, he was raised by his grandfather and grandmother. Now he works in a bakery as a cashier and is happy talking to me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We had a chat for about half an hour. Before leaving I asked him I could take a picture with him and he obliged happily.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He dropped me to my bike while customers were waiting on the counter for him to come back.

My plan was to spend only a night before zooming off early morning towards my destination Kanyakumari. In the night I got a call from one of my friend who asked me to visit Meenakshi Temple. I had no intention to visit initially but then I thought let's give it a visit.\n\nAfter checking into the modest hotel, I asked for dinner recommendations from the helper. He offered to get me food of any cuisine I preferred. I opted for vegetarian food and handed him the money. To my surprise, he returned with chicken noodles, forcing me to remind him that I had asked for vegetarian food. He made a funny face (😅) and apologized before quickly getting me delicious veg noodles instead. The hospitality in this town really amazed me.\n\n## An Unexpected Temple Visit\n\nNext day when I tied my luggage on the bike, I put the destination as Meenakshi temple on my phone.\n\nI navigated towards the temple passing through crowded streets of Madurai. Finally I was in the vicinity of the temple. It was a short 12km ride from my hotel.\n\nI came to a halt on the street, contemplating whether to leave or not, when suddenly a policewoman caught my attention with her call. I was scared. 😂\n\nWhen I turned around she asked me the same set of questions which everyone asked me:\n\nShe: \"Where are you coming from?\"\nMe: \"Bengaluru.\"\nShe: \"On bike?\"\nMe: \"Yes, started yesterday morning and reached yesterday evening.\"\nShe: \"Haaaaaa…. 😱😱\"\nShe: \"No back pain?\"\nMe: \"No, It is a habit now.\" (Trying to look cool, when I have barely done 450+ km in a day 😜)\nShe: \"How did parents give you permission?\"\nMe: \"With a lot of difficult conversations.\"\nShe: \"Hahahaha…\"\nShe: \"Going inside?\"\nMe: \"Yes.\" (I couldn't say no🙈)\n\nI approached the lady near the temple and politely asked, \"Excuse me, would it be possible to keep my helmet in your cabin while I go inside?\" She kindly agreed, and I left my helmet with her before entering the peaceful sanctuary.\n\nAlthough I'm not typically drawn to religious destinations, this temple was different. As I stood before the ornate gates, I found myself meditating for a full 10 minutes. It was the calmest I had ever felt. However, as I hadn't bathed, I chose not to enter and instead turned back at the gate.\n\n## The Journey to Kanyakumari\n\nOnce I retrieved my helmet, I set off on my bike towards Kanyakumari, feeling excited to reach this milestone location. Since my childhood and teenage years, I had read so much about it being the southernmost point of India, closest to the equator, and much more.\n\nThe ride to Kanyakumari was going smoothly until I heard a loud \"clang\" while cruising along the road at 80kmph. Worried, I stopped my bike and realized that my bike's battery cover had fallen off along the way. Despite searching around for it, the cover was nowhere to be found, and I knew I had to let it go.\n\nThe roads leading up to Kanyakumari were breathtaking, with windmills on both sides of the highway. I later learned that Tamil Nadu is home to India's largest windmill farm, producing over 1500MW of energy.\n\n## First Impressions of Kanyakumari\n\nAs the sun started setting, I finally arrived at Kanyakumari and checked into my hotel. Concerned about the missing cover, I attempted to reach out to the Royal Enfield service centre but failed to get any response from them. Nevertheless, I decided to make the most of my trip and explore the beautiful sights that lay ahead.\n\nIn the late evening after taking a good nap, I went out to see Kanyakumari town, and man was I disappointed.\n\nSo much crowd. Lots and lots of people everywhere and not a single good beach.\n\nI thought to myself, \"where am I? Is this what I was looking for? Is this the place for which i drive around 700kms in 2 days? 😕\"\n\nFirst impression is the last impression, right? Or is it?\n\nIn the next article, lets talk about why Kanyakumari has one of the best beaches that I have ever seen and why it's people are so accommodating and friendly that they invited me over a family dinner.\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

If you haven't read it yet, I recommend checking it out first.\n\n## First Impressions\n\nAfter an exhaustive two-day journey covering nearly 800 kilometers from Bengaluru, I finally arrived in Kanyakumari on the evening of February 12th. The fatigue from the continuous travel was weighing heavily on me. Kanyakumari, despite its fame, is not a sprawling town. It stretches merely 4-5 kilometers from one end to the beach. As I made my way towards my hotel, I couldn't help but notice the curious stares from the locals. It was evident that bikers like me were a rarity in this part of India.\n\nI checked into Hotel Raja Palace, which turned out to be quite affordable at just 500 rupees per night. Although the room lacked modern conveniences like Wi-Fi and AC, its economical price and close proximity to the main beach road, a mere 500 meters away, made it a practical choice.\n\n## The Initial Disappointment\n\nAfter taking a refreshing shower and collapsing onto the bed, I finally managed to gather some energy. It was around 7 PM, and with a sense of anticipation, I stepped out to explore the town.\n\nTo my surprise, the streets were teeming with people. Buses, tourist taxis, cars, motorcycles, and what not. Roadside shops and vendors lined the streets, offering an array of snacks, fried fish, toys, shells, and various trinkets. The bustling scene left me feeling disheartened.\n\nI had hoped to discover a place that was less crowded and more quiet, but the reality was quite the opposite. As I walked along the main beach road, there were no empty benches to sit on, no place to stand still and no one to talk to.\n\nI thought to myself,\n\n\"Should I go back to Bengaluru? Was this a mistake to come here and explore all alone?\"\n\nThe initial excitement I had felt now wavered in the face of the overwhelming crowd and noise.\n\n## A Failed Adventure\n\nBrushing off these thoughts, I decided to consult Google Maps in search of a calm spot to gather my thoughts. It pointed me towards Kanyakumari pier, a place that looked good at least in photos. However, as I made my way towards it, my doubts started to intensify.\n\nThe path leading to the pier was dimly lit, with an eerie atmosphere. It was unkempt and gave off a sense of neglect.\n\nReluctantly, I turned back, feeling disheartened by the turn of events. All I wanted at that moment was to find a cozy place to have dinner and retreat to the comfort of my room.\n\n## An Unexpected Encounter\n\nAs I finished my average dinner at one of the local dhabas, I left for my hotel. Just before reaching, a small tea shop caught my attention, and I decided to pause for a cup of tea. While the Anna diligently prepared my tea, I instinctively reached for my phone, hoping to discover any hidden gems in the area.\n\nTo my surprise, an auto-rickshaw driver, who happened to be enjoying his own tea at the shop, struck up a conversation.\n\n\"Tourist?\"\n\n\"Na, traveler.\"\n\n\"Did you like Kanyakumari?\"\n\n\"Na, it is so much crowded. I am thinking to go back.\"\n\n\"Wait one more day sir. It will look different. Today is Sunday.\"\n\nLittle did I know, Kanyakumari had a unique identity beyond its charm as a tourist spot. It is primarily known as a pilgrimage site, drawing devotees from far and wide, especially on weekends, to pay homage at the sacred temple.\n\nThe auto-rickshaw driver's explanation shed light on the origin of the bustling crowds that had flooded the town. It became apparent that my initial disappointment came from an unawareness of the town's true essence.\n\n## Hidden Gems\n\nOur conversation continued:\n\n\"How do you know Hindi so well? People here barely understand Hindi.\"\n\n\"I was in the middle east for couple of years, had to work with people from all over India, hence had to learn Hindi.\"\n\n\"Do you know any good places nearby?\"\n\n\"How are you traveling?\"\n\n\"I have a bike.\"\n\n\"Nice, wait I will show you few places in my phone. For how many days will you stay here?\"\n\n\"One week.\"\n\nThen he told me about few beaches which looked great in photos. He made sure I wrote down everything, along with its google map location so that I do not forget.\n\nApparently most of them were not visited by tourists as they were not aware of them. It was little bit far from the main town.\n\nHere are the places he recommended, which you should definitely try to visit when you're in town:\n\n- Vattakotai beach\n- Chothavilai beach\n- Lemur beach\n- Padmanabhapuram Palace\n- Mathoor Aqueduct\n- Tirparappu Water Falls (Too much crowd, left in few mins)\n- Poovar (Did not go because of time constraint)\n\n## What's Next?\n\nWith an exciting itinerary and a comprehensive list of must-see places, I was eager to explore. However, amidst all the exploration, there was one place that stood out from the rest — Capeista Cafe. A special haven that I vowed to visit every time I find myself in Kanyakumari. About this and much more in the next article.\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

Although the room lacked modern conveniences like Wi-Fi and AC, its economical price and close proximity to the main beach road, a mere 500 meters away, made it a practical choice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-initial-disappointment\">The Initial Disappointment\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>After taking a refreshing shower and collapsing onto the bed, I finally managed to gather some energy. It was around 7 PM, and with a sense of anticipation, I stepped out to explore the town.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To my surprise, the streets were teeming with people. Buses, tourist taxis, cars, motorcycles, and what not. Roadside shops and vendors lined the streets, offering an array of snacks, fried fish, toys, shells, and various trinkets. The bustling scene left me feeling disheartened.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had hoped to discover a place that was less crowded and more quiet, but the reality was quite the opposite. As I walked along the main beach road, there were no empty benches to sit on, no place to stand still and no one to talk to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I thought to myself,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Should I go back to Bengaluru? Was this a mistake to come here and explore all alone?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The initial excitement I had felt now wavered in the face of the overwhelming crowd and noise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"a-failed-adventure\">A Failed Adventure\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Brushing off these thoughts, I decided to consult Google Maps in search of a calm spot to gather my thoughts. It pointed me towards Kanyakumari pier, a place that looked good at least in photos. However, as I made my way towards it, my doubts started to intensify.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The path leading to the pier was dimly lit, with an eerie atmosphere. It was unkempt and gave off a sense of neglect.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Reluctantly, I turned back, feeling disheartened by the turn of events. All I wanted at that moment was to find a cozy place to have dinner and retreat to the comfort of my room.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"an-unexpected-encounter\">An Unexpected Encounter\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>As I finished my average dinner at one of the local dhabas, I left for my hotel. Just before reaching, a small tea shop caught my attention, and I decided to pause for a cup of tea. While the Anna diligently prepared my tea, I instinctively reached for my phone, hoping to discover any hidden gems in the area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To my surprise, an auto-rickshaw driver, who happened to be enjoying his own tea at the shop, struck up a conversation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Tourist?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Na, traveler.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Did you like Kanyakumari?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Na, it is so much crowded. I am thinking to go back.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Wait one more day sir. It will look different. Today is Sunday.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Little did I know, Kanyakumari had a unique identity beyond its charm as a tourist spot. It is primarily known as a pilgrimage site, drawing devotees from far and wide, especially on weekends, to pay homage at the sacred temple.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The auto-rickshaw driver’s explanation shed light on the origin of the bustling crowds that had flooded the town. It became apparent that my initial disappointment came from an unawareness of the town’s true essence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"hidden-gems\">Hidden Gems\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Our conversation continued:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“How do you know Hindi so well? People here barely understand Hindi.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“I was in the middle east for couple of years, had to work with people from all over India, hence had to learn Hindi.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Do you know any good places nearby?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“How are you traveling?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“I have a bike.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Nice, wait I will show you few places in my phone. For how many days will you stay here?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“One week.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then he told me about few beaches which looked great in photos. He made sure I wrote down everything, along with its google map location so that I do not forget.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Apparently most of them were not visited by tourists as they were not aware of them. It was little bit far from the main town.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here are the places he recommended, which you should definitely try to visit when you’re in town:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Vattakotai beach\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Chothavilai beach\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Lemur beach\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Padmanabhapuram Palace\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Mathoor Aqueduct\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Tirparappu Water Falls (Too much crowd, left in few mins)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Poovar (Did not go because of time constraint)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"whats-next\">What’s Next?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>With an exciting itinerary and a comprehensive list of must-see places, I was eager to explore. However, amidst all the exploration, there was one place that stood out from the rest — Capeista Cafe. A special haven that I vowed to visit every time I find myself in Kanyakumari.

This place brought back past memories. This is the place where I first rode a two-wheeler and explored parts of Kerala(Allepey and Munnar). This is also where I had a crazy scooter mishap but came out unscathed, unlike my friend who got a tiny scratch on his knee. He still teases me about it, saying I jinxed his beach plans!\n\n## The Journey\n\nThe journey from Kanyakumari to Kochi was quite challenging. I was traveling on NH66, which in itself was quite a task. There were no dividers throughout the 450 km that I rode, and on top of that, drivers were careless to say the least. It took me around 15 hours to reach.\n\nThat day, I just wanted to chill, skip the Bosco (motorcycle), and relax with a bath and a nap.

I parked my bike, took a cold shower, and went to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, I was able to admire the city and my accommodation. I was staying at Zostel; this was not my first time staying in a hostel, but it had been a while. I was a little bit nervous about the people I would meet there.\n\nI was paying around 500 INR/day, and I had it booked for a week, which was reasonable, now that I think about it. These days, Zostel's prices are skyrocketing. My room was a cozy four-seater with two sets of bunk beds.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Joseph during my stay in the hostel. He was the caretaker and a local guide to whoever was staying in the hostel. He happily shared some insider tips for exploring Fort Kochi.\n\n## Tale of Two Cities\n\nKochi is like that friend who can't decide if they want to chill or party.\n\nIt's divided into two parts: the main city and Fort Kochi. The main city? Well, it's your typical busy, bustling urban scene. The only gem in this concrete jungle is Marine Drive, where you can catch a stunning sunset while bobbing on a boat.\n\nImagine Fort Kochi: towering trees, cozy cafes, and spacious parks. The evenings there are like a dream, wandering from one narrow lane to the next. So peaceful, laid-back, and full of charm!\n\nI wish I had a picture. Somehow I was too busy doing nothing here.\n\nSo, if you're a traveler looking for a place to crash in Kochi, consider staying in the main city… just kidding! Fort Kochi is where the real magic happens.\n\nWill continue my journey in the next article.

Despite maintaining my regular work commitments, I crafted a strategy to make the most of my time in this captivating town.\n\nMy weekday routine looked like this:\n- 4:30 AM: Wake up and complete morning rituals\n- 5:00 AM: Set off on my bike for morning exploration\n- Return to accommodation for work\n- 5:00 PM: Conclude work and head out again\n- 9:00 PM: Return after dinner\n- 9:30 PM: Settle in for the night\n\nFor two months, I maintained this disciplined schedule, successfully balancing my travel aspirations with professional responsibilities.\n\n## Hidden Beaches and Landmarks\n\n### Vattakotai Beach\nMy morning visit revealed an area adorned with abundant moss. Despite the language barrier, I had amusing interactions with local teenagers through sign language. The beach's charm lay in its simplicity - accessible via a road just before the fort, with a clear signboard guiding visitors to a 500-meter off-road trail.\n\n### Chothavilai Beach\nThis exquisite, secluded beach offered breathtaking sunrises along its tranquil shoreline. The morning hours were particularly special, with near-complete solitude making it a perfect spot for peaceful contemplation.\n\n### Lemur Beach\nSlightly more popular than the others, Lemur Beach maintained its natural charm while offering exceptional sunrise views. Well-maintained roads lined with graceful palm trees made the journey as pleasant as the destination itself.\n\n### Mathoor Aqueduct\nThough activities were limited, this scenic spot provided a perfect setting for relaxation and appreciation of the landscape. While there weren't many shops, a few stalls offered refreshments to visitors.\n\n### Other Notable Places\n- Padmanabhapuram Palace (Closed during my visit due to elections)\n- Tirparappu Water Falls (Very crowded, brief visit)\n- Thiruvalluvar Statue and Vivekananda Memorial (Worth visiting, especially the meditation chamber)\n\n## Capeista Café: A Home Away from Home\n\nLocated on the main beach road, Capeista Café became my regular haunt. Initially assuming it would be expensive, I was pleasantly surprised by its reasonable prices.\n\nMy regular order became lemon tea, accompanied by barbecued paneer - a special menu addition made just for me as a vegetarian option. Vijay, the café owner, went above and beyond by setting up a dedicated workspace when I asked about working there during daytime.\n\n### Unexpected Connections\n\nAt the café, I met Thenba, who became my Instagram mentor. Over 2-3 days, he patiently taught me about the platform's significance and functionality. His guidance was invaluable, and I'd be happy to share his contact information with anyone interested in learning more.\n\nOn my last day in Kanyakumari, we all shared a memorable dinner together, marking the end of my week-long stay in this remarkable town.\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

In reality, it was alright — not quite the eighth wonder of the world but also not something ordinary. It was just different; maybe I didn't have the eye for beauty there, or perhaps I couldn't apply Instagram filters to my eyes like how it is in the pictures.\n\nKochi's main beach was also... okay. You might wonder why this guy can't enjoy its beauty more. Maybe I'm just boring, but it's important not to have too high expectations. The only good thing about my experience was a man playing the flute. I bought an ice cream, sat in the shade of a tree, and just enjoyed listening to him play.\n\nAnd it was smelling like fish.\n\n## New Friends and Hostel Life\n\nI met Jatin in the hostel. He was sleeping on the top bunk, and we became friends pretty quickly. He is a CA and is working with a top firm. When we met, he was backpacking across Kerala. That's the fun part about traveling solo and staying in hostels — you meet people who understand your lifestyle, your reasons, and your passion. We spent many evenings just roaming in the city trying to find Pyasam and avocado milkshake. It was an instant click.\n\nThrough him, I met Ila during lunch at the top of our hostel. She lived in Mumbai and was visiting Kochi. Ila and I went to visit Cherai Beach early one morning during the week (can't remember which day exactly). We bought a lottery ticket as well, which we both couldn't win, of course. We also visited St. Francis Church and had quite a long debate about our religious beliefs. She was an avid reader and loved books. One evening, when Jatin and I were roaming on the bike, we found her in one of the cafes reading a book. It was refreshing to see people still enjoying books.\n\n## Local Cuisine\n\nStreet Food in Kochi is quite affordable, especially the breakfast. Keralites are fond of their Parotta (Similar to Laccha parantha from North of India, made with refined flour) and Kadala curry (Black chana dal). Usually, Kadala curry is enjoyed with Puttu (It's a rice dish) but I prefer parotta. I remember the last time I came to Kochi (when I crashed the scooter) I had Parotta and Kadala curry from a street vendor who was selling it on a food truck. Luckily after 3 years, the food truck was still present at the same spot and I could eat it all over again. In fact, all food items which I ate were affordable and tasty at the same time.\n\n## Must-Visit Places\n\nHere are the places I visited and would recommend:\n\n### Cherai Beach\nNoted as a good beach, with other nearby beaches considered less appealing. It is located far from the town. You will have to take a ferry from Fort Kochi. You can take your vehicle on the ferry.\n\n### Chinese Fishing Net\nIn the evening it is picturesque, and you can enjoy the view with large ships in the background.\n\n### Vasco da Gama Church (St. Francis Church)\nIt is one of the oldest Churches in Kochi with a rich history. It is located in the middle of the city. The architecture is awesome and you can spend some time inside it in solitude.\n\n### Marine Drive\nIt is a narrow and bustling waterfront promenade, often crowded but lively. Parking can be challenging due to its central location, but it offers a vibrant experience with plenty of stalls and food shops along the promenade.\n\n### Kumbalangi\nIt is a picture-perfect village renowned for its stunning sunset views. It's an ideal place for off-road trails and evening relaxation, offering a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\n### The Indian Naval Museum\nIt is best explored with a guide, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of its rich history and exhibits. You can find multiple military equipment here including a fighter jet. You can also enjoy a short film on request.\n\n### The Hill Palace Museum\nIt is renowned for its impressive wooden work and extensive collection of historical exhibits, making it a must-visit for history enthusiasts. You can find this in the middle of the main city. It is quite busy on weekends.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nKochi was a blast! I had such a great time there, balancing work and travel smoothly. It felt like I finally hit my stride, not as hectic as before.\n\nNow, onto the next stop — initially thought it might be dull, but guess what? It turned out to be unexpectedly fun because, for the first time since I started this journey, I was all alone by myself and it was lovely.\n\nWill continue my journey in the next article.

In reality, it was alright — not quite the eighth wonder of the world but also not something ordinary. It was just different; maybe I didn’t have the eye for beauty there, or perhaps I couldn’t apply Instagram filters to my eyes like how it is in the pictures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kochi’s main beach was also… okay. You might wonder why this guy can’t enjoy its beauty more. Maybe I’m just boring, but it’s important not to have too high expectations. The only good thing about my experience was a man playing the flute. I bought an ice cream, sat in the shade of a tree, and just enjoyed listening to him play.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And it was smelling like fish.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"new-friends-and-hostel-life\">New Friends and Hostel Life\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I met Jatin in the hostel.

It was another long day. One thing I've noticed is that you'll want to cover as much distance as possible in the first half of the day before fatigue sets in. And it will set in. Your senses won't be as sharp as they were in the morning, you'll need frequent breaks, and constant sips of water. It's crucial to plan your rides carefully when you're riding for more than 8 hours.\n\n## A Japanese-Style Stay\n\nIt was one of those unplanned days that was taking a toll on me, again. Somehow, I reached Mangalore late in the evening. I didn't even notice the time, but street vendors were closing their shops. I had booked my accommodation the night before. I wanted to skip the hostel; not that Mangalore had a lot of good options at that time, but I just wanted some me-time.\n\nI booked a place called Bedspace for 500rs/day. I planned to stay here for 3 days and then change cities. When I entered my \"accommodation,\" I was awestruck; it was a small (really small) and cozy place. It was a 6ft x 5ft cabin with no roof, and there were a total of 12 cabins with a common roof (I hope I am making sense). Each cabin had a bed, a TV, and space for luggage. Yes, all that in such a small space, and it was not uncomfortable. I felt like I was in Japan, in small homes. The guy running the place always wore a bandana as a mask on his face. He was an aspiring actor and showed me a few of his ventures on his phone. We had a good chat.\n\n## Adventure to Bengre Beach\n\nThe next day, I followed the same ritual. I woke up around 4:30, went through my morning routine, and then set out. This time, I was heading towards Bengre main beach, which was far from the main city and required taking a ferry to reach there. I left my hotel around five in the morning and made my way to the ferry point.\n\nUpon arrival, I had to park my bike and then board the ferry. Initially, I thought I could take my Royal Enfield on it, as I did in Kochi, but it wasn't allowed here. The ferry cost me 10rs and was used by locals as well to cross the water.\n\n## The Art of Hitchhiking\n\nWhen I reached the other side, I had no mode of transport, so I resorted to my old method of transportation: asking for lifts from strangers. Almost every time, I received help — not just once, but every time. I recall a time when I was traveling to Nainital with a friend. We asked for lifts and received it five times from different vehicles (jeeps, tractors, cars, etc.). It is one of my core memories.\n\nReturning to the present, someone on a bike gave me a lift. He dropped me off at the beach and then turned around, coming just to drop me. (Humans are just awesome.) I arrived in time for my morning sunrise. It is a small, secluded beach. I crossed a few rocks to reach the beach on the far left. The land was polluted with plastic, but the water was good.\n\nThere was a fisherman there catching fish, and I joined him, although I wasn't much help.\n\n## Morning Rituals and Work\n\nOn my way back, I had Masala dosa and Idli at a local joint and saw kids heading to school. It was heartwarming to see groups of kids excited about going to school.\n\nI then began walking towards the pickup point for the ferry. Once again, I asked for help and received it. A kind person dropped me off where I needed to be. I purchased the ticket and boarded the ferry.\n\nI reached my hotel around 9 AM and started my office work. I planned to finish early so I could head off early.\n\n## Sunset at Surathkal Lighthouse\n\nIn the evening, I took my bike and headed towards Surathkal, which was a 30 km ride from Mangalore. The town is famous for its premier engineering institute, NIT Surathkal (National Institute of Technology).\n\nI was planning to visit the famous Surathkal lighthouse. It was a fairly secluded place overlooking the Arabian sea.\n\nI sat on a big rock and spent a couple of hours admiring the sunset. Because there was a college nearby, you could see a lot of students on the beach. It was nostalgic and took me back to my college days — how we could spend the entire day just talking to each other and not doing anything specific. While I didn't do anything particularly noteworthy during my college days, I still remember everything vividly. Looking back, I wouldn't change a single thing.\n\nWhile exiting the parking area, my bike's wheel got stuck in the sand. I tried to push it, but being a 200kg machine, it didn't budge an inch. I revved the bike like crazy, and eventually, it moved from the ditch. However, in the process, my chain took a hit, resulting in a cranking sound. I planned to get it checked.\n\nI reached my hotel around 9 in the evening after having dinner and went straight to sleep. It was a good day overall.\n\n## Spiritual Journey at Murudeshwar\n\nAs my week in Gokarna neared its end, I visited the magnificent Murudeshwar Temple, with its towering Shiva statue overlooking the Arabian Sea. I happened to arrive during a local festival, when devotees gathered to sing bhajans that echoed across the waves. An elderly woman noticed my interest and spent an hour explaining the significance of each ritual, her eyes crinkling with joy at sharing her tradition.\n\n## An Evening of Wisdom\n\nOn my final evening, Rahul invited me to join him for dinner after he finished selling kulfi for the day. \"I want you to meet someone,\" he said mysteriously. That night, at a small family-run restaurant away from the tourist areas, he introduced me to an elderly baba who had been traveling the subcontinent for decades.\n\nOver a meal of fresh paneer curry and rice, the baba shared wisdom gleaned from years on the road. \"The difference between a tourist and a traveler,\" he told me as we shared our simple feast, \"is that a tourist seeks places, but a traveler seeks insights.\" His words resonated deeply, encapsulating what made Gokarna special — not just its breathtaking landscapes, but the connections formed along the way.\n\n## Farewell to the Coast\n\nAs I packed my bags the next morning, I realized that Gokarna had revealed itself to me gradually — not through itineraries or must-visit lists, but through moments of connection and solitude. From meditative mornings on empty beaches to philosophical conversations under starlit skies, each experience had woven itself into a tapestry of memories I would carry forward.\n\nAs the bike pulled away, I watched the coastline recede in the distance, carrying with me not just photographs of beautiful beaches, but the essence of Gokarna — its unhurried pace, its natural beauty, and most importantly, the genuine connections that transformed a simple beach vacation into a journey of discovery.\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

My vibe was not matching with the city, and I decided to shift. I packed my luggage and tied it on my bike, headed towards Udupi. I had only heard its name when masala dosa was mentioned, and I was curious to see what the town would offer. I was back on NH66.\n\nUdupi is 60km from Mangalore, and on the way, I stopped at a local shop to have my breakfast. There was a fluffy bread on the counter, and I asked what it was. He said \"Mangalore bun.\" I was surprised why I didn't find it in Mangalore. It was a little bit sweet. I had masala dosa with it as well.\n\n## The Unexpected Turn of Events\n\nYou know how sometimes life throws you a curveball? Well, mine came in the form of a local scooty that decided to make my back its new best friend. Yup, you heard that right! As I was cruising along, wham! A scooter hit me from behind. No major injuries, just a broken left side indicator that I think I'll have to fix later.\n\nWhat really warmed my heart were the locals rushing to my aid. \"Hey, are you alright?\" they asked. The vibe was super supportive, but then came the unexpected part — they wanted a little cash, like 500 bucks! Sorry, friends, not today. Just a bit too rich for my broke traveler's budget!\n\n## Settling In: A Cozy Dorm Experience\n\nAfter that little mishap, I needed a place to crash and recharge. I found a cozy dorm for just 300 rupees a night. The best part? For the first three nights, I had the whole room to myself! It was spacious with lots of beds (mostly empty, might I add), and I even discovered clothes drying on the roof. A perfect traveler's lair.\n\nThe only downside was the shared bathroom, but hey, we're roughing it, right? Plus, the wifi was decent, so I could go online and share my experience with you lovely people!\n\n## A Moment of Reflection\n\nLet's get real for a second. After the accident, I was shaken and considered packing my bags for Bengaluru. Fear had crept in, whispering that maybe this trip wasn't meant to be. But after some quiet soul-searching during a sea walk in Udupi, I had an epiphany! I thought, \"What am I doing? This is my adventure!\" So, I pledged to keep riding on this wave of exploration, and boy, am I glad I did.\n\nEvery evening, I returned to that same spot to watch the glorious sunset. The skies were painted in hues of orange and pink, and I was officially in love with Udupi.\n\n## New Friends and Food Adventures\n\nAs luck would have it, my dorm-mate Mayank arrived on the fourth night. He was a YouTuber making videos about travel. Watching him casually chat with his camera felt oddly surreal for me, but we hit it off instantly! We explored the local flavours over a delightful meal at Pai Restaurant — definitely a must-try if you're ever in the area!\n\nAnd guess what? You can catch me in one of his videos! So, make sure to check that out and give his channel some love!\n\n## The Island Escape\n\nThe next highlight of my trip was a ferry ride to St. Mary's Island. For 400 rupees, I hopped on board, though I could've saved a few bucks if I'd waited a bit longer to catch a cheaper ride. But honestly, the adventure was worth it! The island was nothing short of breathtaking — hexagonal rocks, pristine waters, and shells instead of sand! Just be careful not to cut yourself on those little guys!\n\nWhile there, I met Nitin, a super cool director from the Manipal group. He kept calling me \"Raja,\" which cracked me up every time. Throw in a little luck when I almost lost my chappal to the waves (thank you, Nitin, for the rescue!), and the day turned into an unforgettable one.\n\nOh, and about that back ticket? Let's just say the sea gave it a suitable washing. Nitin, being the awesome guy he is, gave me his ticket to sneak back on the ferry. Who needs layers of bureaucracy when you have lovely travelers watching each other's backs?\n\n## Closing Off in Style\n\nBefore I wrapped up my Udupi chapter, I checked out the Shri Hari Kala Museum, which had recently been renovated. For 300 rupees, it was another window into local culture. If you find yourself in Udupi, it's worth a visit!\n\nAs my time in Udupi came to an end, I knew I was ready for my next adventure: Gokarna! I felt rejuvenated, with memories and friendships that will last a lifetime.\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

After the long bike ride from Udupi, I found myself wandering what I thought was the main road, only to discover I was actually circling the back entrance of my own hostel. A quick call to Deep, the hostel manager, solved the mystery with both of us laughing as he guided me to the proper entrance.\n\nStepping into Zen Hostel felt like entering a different world. The open courtyard with hanging plants and scattered cushions immediately eased the tension from my travel-weary shoulders.\n\n## First Taste of Paradise\n\nThat first afternoon, eager to feel sand between my toes, I followed the winding path from the hostel to Kudle Beach. The trail meandered through rocky outcrops before suddenly opening to reveal a golden crescent embraced by the Arabian Sea. The beach was relatively quiet, with just a handful of travelers and locals dotting the shoreline.\n\nNear the southern end of the beach stood a small wooden cart painted in vibrant blues and yellows. Behind it was Rahul, a young local, selling kulfi with a smile that suggested he knew secrets about Gokarna that guidebooks never mentioned.\n\n\"First time in Gokarna?\" he asked, handing me a pistachio kulfi that he insisted was \"on the house for new friends.\" As the cool sweetness melted on my tongue, Rahul pointed toward the rocky promontory at the beach's edge. \"OM Beach is just beyond those rocks. Best to visit early morning before the crowds.\"\n\n## New Friends and Open Roads\n\nTaking Rahul's advice, I woke before sunrise the next day. The hostel was quiet except for a tall figure preparing coffee in the common kitchen — Raman from Bengaluru, who introduced himself as a fellow traveler making his way down the west coast on his Classic 500 motorcycle.\n\n\"Heading to OM Beach?\" he asked. \"The sunrise view from there is worth the early start.\"\n\nTogether we hiked over the rocky terrain separating the beaches, reaching OM Beach just as the first light began to paint the sky in watercolor hues of pink and gold. The beach, shaped naturally like the sacred Om symbol, stretched before us — empty save for a few fishermen preparing their morning catch.\n\n\"How does this classic 500 ride\"?\n\nRaman smiled, reaching into his pocket for his keys. \"Why rent when you can borrow? Take mine for the day — just return with a full tank and stories to share.\"\n\nHis unexpected generosity changed the course of my day. With the wind in my hair and the rumble of the Classic 500 beneath me, I explored the coastal roads, stopping at viewpoints that revealed the coastline's dramatic beauty from above. The freedom of the open road created a perfect counterpoint to the previous day's meandering exploration.\n\n## Paradise Found\n\nThe next morning, I decided to seek out Paradise Beach, which locals had described as \"Gokarna's hidden gem.\"\n\nParadise Beach lived up to its name — a small stretch of pristine sand accessible only by boat or a challenging trek. I spent hours there, reading under the shade of palm trees and occasionally dipping into the crystalline waters. The solitude was occasionally broken by the arrival of small boats bringing travelers, but the beach never felt crowded.\n\nIn the late afternoon, I returned to Kudle Beach, where I sought out Rahul's kulfi cart, now becoming a daily ritual. \"You look like you've found some peace today,\" he observed, handing me a saffron kulfi. This time, I insisted on paying, and our conversation turned to his life in Gokarna. Born and raised here, Rahul had seen the transformation from a pilgrim town to a traveler's haven. \"But the soul remains the same,\" he said, gesturing toward the Mahabaleshwar Temple visible in the distance.\n\n## The Rhythm of Discovery\n\nThe following days developed a pleasant rhythm. Mornings were for exploration — one day trekking to the more remote Half Moon Beach, where I encountered a troop of curious langurs and was rescued by an experienced hiker named Bob who taught me how to navigate wildlife encounters with calm confidence.\n\nAnother day was dedicated to inland exploration, visiting the mysterious Yana Caves with their towering 90-meter black limestone formations. The temperature dropped noticeably as I approached the caves, the dense forest creating a microclimate that felt worlds away from the coastal warmth.\n\nAfternoons often found me at different beaches — the crowded Gokarna Main Beach with its religious significance, the secluded Patanga Beach where I rarely saw another soul, and my personal favorite, Gangavalli Beach. I discovered this hidden gem late in my trip and found myself completely alone save for massive fishing nets spread across the shore — silent sentinels I'd never encountered before.\n\nEach evening, I would seek out Rahul's kulfi cart, our conversations deepening with each meeting. Through him, I learned about local festivals, fishing traditions, and the best spots to watch the sunset away from tourist crowds.\n\n## Sacred Encounters\n\nAs my week in Gokarna neared its end, I visited the magnificent Murudeshwar Temple, with its towering Shiva statue overlooking the Arabian Sea. I happened to arrive during a local festival, when devotees gathered to sing bhajans that echoed across the waves. An elderly woman noticed my interest and spent an hour explaining the significance of each ritual, her eyes crinkling with joy at sharing her tradition.\n\nOn my final evening, Rahul invited me to join him for dinner after he finished selling kulfi for the day. \"I want you to meet someone,\" he said mysteriously. That night, at a small family-run restaurant away from the tourist areas, he introduced me to an elderly baba who had been traveling the subcontinent for decades.\n\nOver a meal of fresh paneer curry and rice, the baba shared wisdom gleaned from years on the road. \"The difference between a tourist and a traveler,\" he told me as we shared our simple feast, \"is that a tourist seeks places, but a traveler seeks insights.\" His words resonated deeply, encapsulating what made Gokarna special — not just its breathtaking landscapes, but the connections formed along the way.\n\n## Farewell to the Coast\n\nAs I packed my bags the next morning, I realized that Gokarna had revealed itself to me gradually — not through itineraries or must-visit lists, but through moments of connection and solitude. From meditative mornings on empty beaches to philosophical conversations under starlit skies, each experience had woven itself into a tapestry of memories I would carry forward.\n\nAs the bike pulled away, I watched the coastline recede in the distance, carrying with me not just photographs of beautiful beaches, but the essence of Gokarna — its unhurried pace, its natural beauty, and most importantly, the genuine connections that transformed a simple beach vacation into a journey of discovery.\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

As I splashed cold water on my face, a mix of excitement and trepidation filled my chest. Today's challenge: 585 kilometers on my motorcycle, all in a single push.\n\nThe pre-dawn air carried a sharp chill as I secured my backpack and kicked the engine to life. The empty streets belonged to me as I navigated out of the city, watching the sky transform from inky black to soft lavender. By the time the sun fully emerged, I was already deep into rural landscapes, fields stretching endlessly on either side of the ribbon of asphalt.\n\nHours melted away with the rhythm of the engine beneath me. I stopped only for fuel and quick stretches, determined to cover ground while daylight remained. The afternoon brought scorching heat that seeped through my riding jacket, but the constant wind offered some relief.\n\nThe real challenge emerged as darkness fell and I approached my destination city. My muscles ached from holding the same position for hours, and fatigue had dulled my reflexes. In the chaos of evening traffic, a car swerved unexpectedly — our eyes locked in mutual panic as I narrowly avoided collision. The adrenaline surge carried me through the final kilometers to my friend's apartment, where I arrived just before midnight, dismounting on wobbly legs and feeling the strange phantom vibration that follows a day-long ride.\n\n## Parvati Perspectives\n\nAfter recovering with a deep sleep, I set out the next day to explore Parvati Hill. A local had tipped me off about accessing it through the back entrance — advice that proved invaluable. While tourists crowded the main gate (which was fortunately closed), I found myself practically alone as I climbed the less-traveled path.\n\nThe effort of the ascent faded immediately upon reaching the summit. Spread before me was a panoramic view of the city, buildings reduced to miniature models from this elevation. I lingered as the setting sun transformed the urban sprawl into a glittering tapestry, the harsh edges of concrete softened by golden hour light. With barely another soul around, I captured photographs without hurry, occasionally setting my camera aside simply to absorb the moment.\n\n## Waterside Wanderings\n\nEmboldened by the previous day's exploration, I plotted a course to Khadakwasla Dam the following morning. What my map app estimated as a quick trip turned into an endurance test. Traffic clogged narrow roads, and local driving customs seemed to involve creative interpretation of lane markings. I found myself constantly adjusting course as scooters, cars, and even the occasional cow claimed their own right-of-way.\n\nWhen I finally reached the dam in late afternoon, the frustrations of the journey dissolved. The vast expanse of water reflected clouds with mirror-like precision, and a gentle breeze carried the scent of wet earth. Along the shore, enterprising vendors had set up small food stalls where families gathered on colorful mats, sharing meals and conversation. Children darted between groups, some calling out offerings of horse rides along the water's edge — a timeless scene of simple pleasures.\n\nI had hoped to meet my old schoolmate Abhishek afterward, but a quick call revealed he was out of town. Rather than brave the traffic again, I decided to give both myself and my motorcycle a well-deserved rest day.\n\n## Lonavala Landscapes\n\nFriday morning arrived with clear skies — perfect conditions for the ride to Lonavala. The route offered sweeping curves through gradually rising elevation, the kind of road that motorcyclists dream about. My enjoyment was briefly interrupted when I noticed my left indicator dangling precariously — a casualty of the previous days' rough roads. A roadside mechanic shop provided thin wire, which proved sufficient for a temporary repair that held surprisingly well.\n\nLonavala itself delivered mixed experiences. Lions View Point, despite its promising name, offered views that couldn't quite match the hype. The local dam lacked proper access, leaving me to admire it from an awkward distance. I began questioning my route choices until I arrived at Pavna Lake.\n\nHere was the tranquility I'd been seeking. The lake surface remained impossibly still, mirroring the surrounding hills with perfect clarity. I found a smooth rock at the water's edge and sat in peaceful contemplation, occasionally watching adventure-seekers attempting water sports in the distance. A conversation with a nearby cottage owner revealed affordable lakeside accommodations — valuable intelligence for future trips.\n\nThe journey back provided an unexpected encounter. A group of children approached my stopped motorcycle, hands extended. I initially rode past, but something in their expressions pulled me back. After a moment's hesitation, I handed over a hundred-rupee note, receiving beaming smiles in return. That brief exchange lingered in my thoughts long after I returned to my accommodation.\n\n## Panchgani Heights\n\nA conversation with my friend Ila yielded enthusiastic recommendations for Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar. With renewed energy, I set out early the next morning, arriving at Table Land as vendors were still setting up for the day.\n\nA tout immediately approached, offering a camel ride package to nine viewpoints for 2,500 rupees. After polite refusal, I discovered the area was easily walkable, allowing me to explore at my own pace without transportation costs. The plateau offered breathtaking vistas at every turn, and I eventually settled beneath a solitary tree, enjoying the panoramic views from natural shade.\n\nMid-afternoon hunger led me to Lucky Café, a modest establishment with character etched into its weathered walls. Their masala chai and freshly baked biscuits provided simple but profound satisfaction after hours of exploration. The café's worn wooden chairs and unpretentious atmosphere created exactly the authentic experience I'd hoped to find.\n\nCuriosity drew me next to a local cheese factory, where I succumbed to marketing promises and purchased an overpriced cheesecake that proved disappointingly bland. The silver lining? Free water refills for my bottles, which I shamelessly exploited four times over.\n\n## View in Panchgani\n\n## Final Discoveries\n\nMapro Garden appeared next on my itinerary, a shrine to all things strawberry. Weekend crowds filled every pathway, examining products and forming long lines at food counters. The garden itself offered pleasant landscaping, but commercial elements dominated the experience. I browsed the supermarket section briefly before declining to join the queue for pizza priced well beyond its likely quality.\n\nWith afternoon fading, I navigated to Mahabaleshwar temple, where ancient stone architecture provided stark contrast to Mapro's commercial bustle. The temple complex offered multiple exploration routes, each revealing new perspectives on centuries-old craftsmanship. The cool stone underfoot and gentle fragrance of incense created an atmosphere of timeless serenity — a perfect counterbalance to days spent in constant motion.\n\nAs daylight held steady, I decided to retrace my route to Lucky Café, drawn back by their unpretentious charm. A final cup of tea accompanied by bun maska (buttered bread) gave me time to mentally organize the week's experiences before beginning the journey home.\n\nI capped the adventure with dinner at a highway dhaba, savoring robust flavors while watching fellow travelers come and go. The meal provided perfect closure — satisfying without pretension, much like the journey itself.\n\n## Homeward Bound\n\nAs twilight faded into night, I guided my faithful motorcycle homeward. The week had delivered everything I seek from the open road: challenge and reward, solitude and connection, exhaustion and exhilaration. The wind carried the scent of jasmine as I completed the final kilometers, already planning when I might escape again on two wheels.\n\nFor anyone hesitating over their own potential adventure: go. The open road offers lessons and memories impossible to find elsewhere. The difficulties — mechanical challenges, physical discomfort, unexpected detours — eventually transform into the stories you'll tell most fondly. What adventures await you beyond your comfort zone?\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

A quick Google search led me to Mulki, a quaint town that felt more like a secluded village. The place, I learned, was famous for three things: its surf school, kayaking opportunities, and the mysterious Bioluminescence beach (yes, I had to double-check that spelling!).\n\n## Dawn Adventure\n\nDeciding to try kayaking for the first time, I booked an early morning slot that would allow me to return in time for my office work. At 4:30 AM, while the world still slept, I set out on my 30km journey from my hotel. The route was refreshingly simple - just follow the main highway towards Udupi until you reach Mulki.\n\nArriving at the kayaking spot in darkness, I found myself alone in the pre-dawn stillness. A call to the manager confirmed my 6 AM slot, and being a weekday, I discovered I was the only booking. As I waited, the solitude was broken by a group of college students emerging from a nearby tent. Our conversation revealed they were there for a week-long Level 1 surf course - their enthusiasm for the waves was contagious.\n\n## First Strokes\n\nWhen my instructor arrived, he began with the basics - steering techniques, forward and reverse movements. Everything seemed straightforward in theory, but as I approached the single-person kayak, nervousness crept in. Not being a swimmer, the sight of the life jacket barely covering my chest did little to boost my confidence.\n\nThe kayak wobbled as I stepped in, sending a jolt of fear through me. Someone handed me the paddle, and with trembling hands, I took my first strokes. Gradually, as the kayak responded to my movements, confidence began to build. After twenty minutes, I found myself surprisingly comfortable, even daring to observe the jellyfish that occasionally drifted nearby (though the thought of capsizing quickly tempered my curiosity).\n\n## Sunrise Stories\n\nAs the sun began its ascent, painting the sky in brilliant hues, I paused my paddling to take in the spectacle. My instructor, I learned, had an equally colorful story to share. Originally from Uttar Pradesh, he had followed his elder brother here in search of employment - a familiar tale of migration from tier-three cities in pursuit of opportunities to support family back home.\n\nHis monthly remittances to his parents filled him with pride, and as I sat in my anchored kayak, his story resonated deeply with the universal pursuit of better prospects and family devotion.\n\n## Peaceful Waters\n\nThree hours passed swiftly on the water, most spent in peaceful contemplation after anchoring in the middle of the sea. Despite the constant vigilance required to keep my phone safe in zipperless shorts, I managed to share the experience with family and friends through video calls - their amazement at the serene setting matching my own.\n\nBy 9 AM, I was back on land, heading straight to my trusty Bosco (my bike), racing against time to make it back to my hotel in Mangalore for the morning scrum call.\n\n## A Hidden Gem\n\nFor anyone visiting Mangalore or Udupi, I strongly recommend taking a detour to Mulki. If you're seeking an escape from urban chaos or want to try kayaking for the first time, this hidden gem offers the perfect blend of adventure and tranquility.\n\nThat evening, finding Mangalore's entertainment options limited, I decided to continue my journey to Udupi the next day. The proximity meant I could easily reach there before my workday began, setting the stage for new adventures.\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

The morning held promise — clear skies, my trusty bike prepped and ready, and the excitement of exploring Maharashtra's crown jewel. Little did I know that my journey would begin with an unexpected hiccup.\n\nJust as I was about to embark, I discovered my tire had punctured. Not the auspicious start I had imagined! Instead of hitting the highway, I found myself searching for a mechanic. The repair cost me a whopping 2,200 rupees — the tire itself needed patching as it was damaged, not just the tube. The mechanic discovered and fixed four separate punctures in the tube. An expensive setback, but essential to continue my journey safely.\n\n## Navigating Construction Chaos\n\nWith my motorcycle finally roadworthy again, I set off toward Mumbai, only to face another challenge — the roads were a labyrinth of confusion. Construction work dominated the route, with detours and temporary paths making navigation a test of patience. Road signs appeared and disappeared among the maze of machinery and diverted traffic.\n\nDuring one particularly confusing stretch, I stopped at a petrol pump, parched and desperate for water. When I asked for a glass, the employee apologetically explained they couldn't keep glasses out — \"People steal them,\" he said, offering me his personal water bottle instead. This small act of kindness among the chaos of construction dust and blaring horns reminded me why I love road trips — these genuine human connections that emerge in unexpected places.\n\n## Accommodation Adventures\n\nBy late afternoon, I finally reached my pre-booked hotel in Mumbai, only to discover it was far from what the online photos had promised. Old, dirty, and generally uninviting, I decided immediately this wouldn't be my resting place. Thankfully, a friend offered their place for the evening, giving me breathing room to find proper accommodation.\n\nThe next day, I went hotel-hunting in person rather than trusting online listings. I found a decent place for 1,500 rupees per day — nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable, which was all I needed after weeks on the road.\n\n## Three Days of Exploration\n\nFor the next three days, I enjoyed exploring the surrounding areas. One morning, I rode to what was marked as a waterfall on the highway. Amusingly, there wasn't a drop of water to be seen, but the spot near Hazrat Fakir Shah Baba Darbar on NH 48 offered a surprisingly good viewpoint overlooking the highway. I spent a peaceful morning there, watching traffic flow like a river of metal and color below.\n\n## The Challenging Return\n\nThe ride from Kalyan to Locomo Hostel tested my patience like nothing else on my six-week journey. What should have been a 60-kilometer trip stretched into a three-hour ordeal through Mumbai's unforgiving traffic. The last kilometer alone took 45 minutes to navigate — a perfect microcosm of Mumbai's traffic situation.\n\nDuring this crawl through congested streets, I found myself alongside an older gentleman on a scooter. We chatted briefly about the traffic, the weather, and the general state of Mumbai's roads. Before filtering ahead, he offered a simple \"all the best for your journey\" — a small encouragement that somehow made the remaining traffic more bearable.\n\n## Locomo Hostel: A Rider's Haven\n\nAfter my hotel stay, I switched to Locomo Hostel for four days — a decision that enriched my Mumbai experience significantly. The hostel had dedicated motorcycle parking, which any rider knows is worth its weight in gold in a crowded city like Mumbai. Their rooftop featured a lovely grass area where guests gathered in the evenings, and the automated lighting systems throughout gave the place a modern feel.\n\nI slept in a ten-person dorm that was thoughtfully designed — each bed had its own fan and a secure storage space for belongings. After weeks of varying accommodation quality on the road, these small comforts felt luxurious.\n\n## Meaningful Encounters\n\nThe true highlight of Locomo wasn't the amenities but the people. I was delighted to run into Uday Pratap, whom I'd previously met in Gokarna earlier in my journey. We celebrated our reunion with masala lemon ginger tea, though we agreed it wasn't particularly impressive.\n\nOne evening, I had a fascinating conversation with a gentleman who had joined his company as a trainee and eventually retired as its CEO. His career journey spanning decades offered a perspective on professional growth that you can't find in business books.\n\nI also met a second-year college student buzzing with entrepreneurial energy. He was adamant about starting his own venture rather than \"working for others,\" and was methodically gathering experiences and insights from fellow travelers. Interestingly, he held skeptical views about cryptocurrency, preferring to focus on more traditional business models.\n\n## Exploring Mumbai's Landmarks\n\nDespite Mumbai's notorious traffic, I strategically planned my sightseeing. When staying near Kalyan, I used my motorcycle, but otherwise relied on the city's efficient train system. The UTS app became my best friend — providing ridiculously cheap tickets for timely trains.\n\nI visited Marine Drive, feeling the sea breeze that felt distinctly different from the coastal winds I'd experienced elsewhere on my journey. The Hanging Garden offered a welcome respite from urban chaos — divided into two sections on either side of the road, it made for a refreshing morning walk. I couldn't help noticing an impressively rotund dog lounging there, and the whimsical giant shoe house that seemed to delight every child who passed it.\n\n## Street Observations\n\nSometimes a road-weary traveler just needs to sit and observe. Before catching my train back to the hostel, I enjoyed a surprisingly refreshing 5-rupee lemon water from a street vendor — proving again that price and quality don't always correlate.\n\n## Culinary Experiences\n\nMumbai's food scene offered mixed experiences. Near CST station, I discovered delicious parotta with kadala curry that transported my taste buds straight to Kerala. Less impressive was a \"nachos burger\" from a burger joint that seemed to have misunderstood the concept of what constitutes \"nachos.\"\n\n## Final Mumbai Memories\n\nBefore departing for Surat — the next stop on my west coast tour — I attempted a food pilgrimage for Mumbai's famous pav bhaji. Unfortunately, the recommended place had either moved or closed, leaving me with an unfulfilled culinary quest. Sometimes, even the best-planned adventures leave loose ends that beckon you to return someday.\n\nIn the quietness of my hostel dorm that last night, reflecting on my Mumbai experience, I realized how the initial tire puncture had set the tone for my entire stay — unexpected, occasionally frustrating, but ultimately revealing the city's character through its challenges rather than despite them.\n\n## An Invitation to Fellow Riders\n\nFor those planning their own motorcycle journey through Mumbai, I offer this hard-earned advice: embrace the chaos, budget extra time for traffic (and then add more), and consider train travel for inner-city exploration. The dedicated parking at Locomo Hostel makes it worth considering for riders, and the connections you'll make with fellow travelers might just be the highlight of your Mumbai experience.\n\nHave you had mechanical troubles that changed the course of your journey?

After saying goodbye to Uday, I kicked my bike to life and started the journey to Surat. The roads were clear this early, and I felt optimistic about making good time.\n\nTwo hours into the ride, my eyes grew heavy. The road ahead blurred, and I knew I needed to stop before I risked falling asleep on my bike.\n\n\"Just a quick break,\" I told myself, pulling into a small roadside dhaba. The aroma of fresh food made me realize I was hungry too.\n\n\"One coffee, please. Make it strong,\" I said to the weathered man behind the counter. As I sipped the hot, bitter brew, I checked my trip meter and smiled. I had just crossed 5,000 kilometers on this journey! I took a deep breath, feeling a surge of pride at how far I'd come in just six weeks.\n\n## Welcome to Surat: Culture Shock\n\nAs I entered Surat city limits, my good mood quickly dissolved into bewilderment. Cars, bikes, and auto-rickshaws zoomed in all directions, cutting each other off and disregarding every traffic rule I'd ever learned.\n\n\"Is this normal?\" I wondered, carefully following the proper lanes. At one red light, I stopped and waited while everyone else simply continued through! Drivers behind me honked impatiently, and one man on a scooter made a mocking \"po-po\" sound as he passed me, as if I were foolish for actually stopping at a red light. I shook my head in disbelief and waited until it turned green.\n\nAfter navigating through the chaotic traffic maze, I finally reached my hotel. The basement parking was cramped but secure. A young hotel attendant showed me to my room, which felt like stepping into an oven.\n\n\"Where's the AC?\" I asked, scanning the sweltering room.\n\n\"Oh, we have AC, sir, but it's not working right now,\" he said with a smile that never reached his eyes.\n\nLater, when I confronted the manager about it, he looked directly at me and said, \"We don't have any AC rooms.\"\n\nMy jaw dropped. Walking back to my room, I passed an open door where I could clearly see an air conditioner running in another guest's room.\n\n\"They just lied to my face,\" I muttered, feeling sweat trickle down my back. \"Welcome to Surat, I guess.\"\n\n## First Impressions: Exploring the City\n\nToo hot to remain in my room, I decided to explore the city. I walked to Maharana Pratap Udyan park, which bustled with families enjoying their weekend. Children darted about while parents relaxed on benches, everyone seeming content to be outdoors.\n\nA food vendor caught my attention, selling masala aloo for just 10 rupees. The spicy potatoes scorched my tongue but tasted incredible. As dusk approached, I caught a cab back to my hotel, my legs weary from walking all day.\n\nThe next morning, hoping to find a beautiful coastline like in Mumbai, I rode to a nearby beach. What I discovered was nothing like the beaches I'd seen on my trip so far. The sand was littered with debris, the water murky, and the entire place had a melancholy, neglected atmosphere.\n\n## An Unexpected Encounter\n\nI left the beach hastily, disappointed by both the view and the experience. On my way back into the city, I noticed a man walking along the highway under the scorching sun. He waved, requesting a ride, and I pulled over.\n\n\"Where are you heading?\" I asked.\n\n\"Just into the city center,\" he replied, climbing onto the back of my bike.\n\nAs we rode, he shared his story. He was a middle-aged man who had worked in the travel industry from 1992 to 1998, now employed by Hyundai. His voice softened when he explained why he left his travel job.\n\n\"My close friend died in an accident in Rajasthan,\" he confided. \"I couldn't bring myself to go there anymore, even though I knew all the routes by heart.\"\n\nHe offered some riding wisdom too. \"I love riding at night when there's no traffic,\" he said. \"For those blinding headlights from trucks, don't look directly at them. Keep your eyes straight ahead on the road.\" It echoed the same advice my old friend had given me weeks earlier — a universal truth among riders.\n\n## Culinary Adventures and Misadventures\n\nAfter dropping him off, my stomach growled fiercely. I stopped at a paratha stall, shocked to see the cheapest one cost 120 rupees — highway robbery for street food!\n\nThat night, I decided to compensate for the expensive lunch by taking advantage of my hotel's unlimited dosa offer. The waiter looked astonished as I devoured my seventh paper dosa, wiping sambar from my chin with satisfaction.\n\n\"You eat a lot,\" laughed a young waiter from Bihar who kept bringing fresh dosas to my table. He seemed friendly and asked for my number to share local sightseeing recommendations. But later that night, my phone buzzed incessantly with messages from him. After attempting to respond politely a few times, I realized he was becoming too personal and had to block his number.\n\n## The Statue of Unity: A Journey Within a Journey\n\nThe primary reason I had added Surat to my itinerary was to visit the renowned Statue of Unity nearby. I woke early, excited to see the world's tallest statue. The morning air felt invigorating against my face as I rode out of the city. The roads began smooth but deteriorated halfway there.\n\nBy 9 AM, I reached the visitor center, parked my bike, and purchased a 380-rupee ticket. Little did I know the adventure was just beginning! I queued for 30 minutes waiting for the air-conditioned bus to transport us to the actual statue. First, I had to check my helmet at a cloakroom, then at the security checkpoint, they refused to let me bring my laptop inside.\n\n\"You'll have to leave it at the cloakroom,\" the guard instructed.\n\n\"But the cloakroom is all the way back where I started!\" I sighed, trudging back through the increasing heat.\n\nFinally inside, the statue's base was impressive — immaculately clean with ample space to move around. Most displays focused on information about Sardar Patel rather than actual historic artifacts. When I tried to get water, the attendant at the water station turned away without acknowledging me.\n\nThe elevator journey to the viewing gallery was swift, but honestly, the panorama wasn't as breathtaking as I had anticipated. What truly awed me was standing at the foot of the statue and gazing upward. It was monumentally massive — one thumb of the statue's foot was approximately my height!\n\n## A Starbucks First and Unexpected Kindness\n\nAfter exploring the statue, I retrieved my laptop and spotted a Starbucks café. Having never visited one before, I decided to treat myself.\n\n\"First time at Starbucks,\" I told the barista with a smile.\n\nThe café had just one charging point, and I needed to take a work call. To my surprise, a young couple noticed me searching and beckoned me over.\n\n\"You can use this outlet,\" they offered, rearranging their belongings to make space for me. \"We're finished charging.\"\n\nI ordered a coffee and settled in for my meeting. Later, famished from all the walking, I tried a paneer wrap that proved to be delicious. As the afternoon crowd thinned, a barista approached me.\n\n\"Would you like to try our coffee tasting?\" she offered.\n\nFor the next fifteen minutes, she taught me how to properly smell, slurp, and taste their Italian roast coffee. The robust, rich flavor was unlike any coffee I'd encountered on my journey.\n\nBy 4 PM, the café was growing crowded again, and I didn't want to monopolize space. I gathered my belongings and headed back to the bus stop. The return journey to my motorcycle seemed twice as long in the afternoon heat.\n\nThe shops surrounding the statue area looked unappealing — not establishments you'd trust for a meal. My stomach protested as I began the hot ride back to Surat, forcing me to stop at a marginally cleaner-looking establishment for a quick bite.\n\n## Reflections and Turning South\n\nBack at my hotel that night, I indulged in one more dosa dinner before collapsing into bed, exhausted but satisfied.\n\nAs I packed the next morning, deciding to head back to Mumbai instead of attempting the 900-kilometer stretch to Goa, I reflected on Surat. The lawless traffic, being scammed twice, the disappointing beach — it wasn't my favorite destination. But I had reached the northernmost point of my journey, and there was something significant about that milestone.\n\nSix weeks on the road had taught me that not every place would astonish me, but every place would teach me something valuable. Surat had shown me how to remain patient when people attempted to take advantage of me and how to find small joys even in challenging circumstances — like unlimited dosas and my first Starbucks experience.\n\nAs I secured my bag to my motorcycle and donned my helmet, I felt ready for the ride back to Mumbai. The journey wasn't over yet, but I had reached my turning point. From here, I was heading home — one kilometer at a time.\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/).

As dusk approached, I caught a cab back to my hotel, my legs weary from walking all day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The next morning, hoping to find a beautiful coastline like in Mumbai, I rode to a nearby beach. What I discovered was nothing like the beaches I’d seen on my trip so far. The sand was littered with debris, the water murky, and the entire place had a melancholy, neglected atmosphere.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"an-unexpected-encounter\">An Unexpected Encounter\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I left the beach hastily, disappointed by both the view and the experience. On my way back into the city, I noticed a man walking along the highway under the scorching sun. He waved, requesting a ride, and I pulled over.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Where are you heading?” I asked.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Just into the city center,” he replied, climbing onto the back of my bike.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As we rode, he shared his story. He was a middle-aged man who had worked in the travel industry from 1992 to 1998, now employed by Hyundai. His voice softened when he explained why he left his travel job.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“My close friend died in an accident in Rajasthan,” he confided. “I couldn’t bring myself to go there anymore, even though I knew all the routes by heart.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He offered some riding wisdom too. “I love riding at night when there’s no traffic,” he said. “For those blinding headlights from trucks, don’t look directly at them. Keep your eyes straight ahead on the road.” It echoed the same advice my old friend had given me weeks earlier — a universal truth among riders.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"culinary-adventures-and-misadventures\">Culinary Adventures and Misadventures\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>After dropping him off, my stomach growled fiercely. I stopped at a paratha stall, shocked to see the cheapest one cost 120 rupees — highway robbery for street food!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That night, I decided to compensate for the expensive lunch by taking advantage of my hotel’s unlimited dosa offer. The waiter looked astonished as I devoured my seventh paper dosa, wiping sambar from my chin with satisfaction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“You eat a lot,” laughed a young waiter from Bihar who kept bringing fresh dosas to my table. He seemed friendly and asked for my number to share local sightseeing recommendations. But later that night, my phone buzzed incessantly with messages from him. After attempting to respond politely a few times, I realized he was becoming too personal and had to block his number.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-statue-of-unity-a-journey-within-a-journey\">The Statue of Unity: A Journey Within a Journey\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The primary reason I had added Surat to my itinerary was to visit the renowned Statue of Unity nearby. I woke early, excited to see the world’s tallest statue. The morning air felt invigorating against my face as I rode out of the city. The roads began smooth but deteriorated halfway there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By 9 AM, I reached the visitor center, parked my bike, and purchased a 380-rupee ticket. Little did I know the adventure was just beginning! I queued for 30 minutes waiting for the air-conditioned bus to transport us to the actual statue. First, I had to check my helmet at a cloakroom, then at the security checkpoint, they refused to let me bring my laptop inside.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“You’ll have to leave it at the cloakroom,” the guard instructed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“But the cloakroom is all the way back where I started!” I sighed, trudging back through the increasing heat.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finally inside, the statue’s base was impressive — immaculately clean with ample space to move around. Most displays focused on information about Sardar Patel rather than actual historic artifacts. When I tried to get water, the attendant at the water station turned away without acknowledging me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The elevator journey to the viewing gallery was swift, but honestly, the panorama wasn’t as breathtaking as I had anticipated. What truly awed me was standing at the foot of the statue and gazing upward. It was monumentally massive — one thumb of the statue’s foot was approximately my height!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"a-starbucks-first-and-unexpected-kindness\">A Starbucks First and Unexpected Kindness\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>After exploring the statue, I retrieved my laptop and spotted a Starbucks café. Having never visited one before, I decided to treat myself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“First time at Starbucks,” I told the barista with a smile.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The café had just one charging point, and I needed to take a work call. To my surprise, a young couple noticed me searching and beckoned me over.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“You can use this outlet,” they offered, rearranging their belongings to make space for me. “We’re finished charging.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I ordered a coffee and settled in for my meeting. Later, famished from all the walking, I tried a paneer wrap that proved to be delicious. As the afternoon crowd thinned, a barista approached me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Would you like to try our coffee tasting?” she offered.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the next fifteen minutes, she taught me how to properly smell, slurp, and taste their Italian roast coffee. The robust, rich flavor was unlike any coffee I’d encountered on my journey.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By 4 PM, the café was growing crowded again, and I didn’t want to monopolize space. I gathered my belongings and headed back to the bus stop. The return journey to my motorcycle seemed twice as long in the afternoon heat.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The shops surrounding the statue area looked unappealing — not establishments you’d trust for a meal. My stomach protested as I began the hot ride back to Surat, forcing me to stop at a marginally cleaner-looking establishment for a quick bite.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"reflections-and-turning-south\">Reflections and Turning South\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Back at my hotel that night, I indulged in one more dosa dinner before collapsing into bed, exhausted but satisfied.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As I packed the next morning, deciding to head back to Mumbai instead of attempting the 900-kilometer stretch to Goa, I reflected on Surat. The lawless traffic, being scammed twice, the disappointing beach — it wasn’t my favorite destination. But I had reached the northernmost point of my journey, and there was something significant about that milestone.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Six weeks on the road had taught me that not every place would astonish me, but every place would teach me something valuable. Surat had shown me how to remain patient when people attempted to take advantage of me and how to find small joys even in challenging circumstances — like unlimited dosas and my first Starbucks experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As I secured my bag to my motorcycle and donned my helmet, I felt ready for the ride back to Mumbai. The journey wasn’t over yet, but I had reached my turning point. From here, I was heading home — one kilometer at a time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>If you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, please let me know on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pallav_jha26/\">Instagram\u003C/a>.

This is the story of how I set out alone on my Suzuki V-Strom SX toward Kudremukh National Park, only to discover that sometimes the best journeys bring unexpected companions.\nIf you are not a paid user but would still like to read the article please, head on to this link.\n\n![Kudremukh National Park - A view of the mountains and lush greenery](/placeholder-social.jpg)\n\n## The Journey Begins\n\nSomewhere in last week of December last year, with Bengaluru's morning traffic still yawning behind me, I pointed my bike south and twisted the throttle. The bike responded eagerly, as if it too had been waiting for this escape from the city's relentless rhythm.\n\nThe journey began smoothly enough - 280 kilometers of relatively straight highways under a bright sunny sky, the kind of riding that lets your mind wander while your body settles into the mechanical meditation of long-distance motorcycling. But it was the final 60 kilometers that made my heart race. The road transformed into a serpentine delight, winding through the foothills of the Western Ghats. Each curve invited a perfect lean, each straightaway a moment to admire the increasingly lush surroundings. For riders, these are the roads we dream about.\n\nSometimes travel plans unravel, only to reweave themselves into something better. My original accommodation fell through, but fate had better ideas. I found myself at a humble homestay nestled within Kudremukh National Park itself - a simple place charging ₹1,300 per night including meals, but offering million-dollar views from every window. The host welcomed me with the kind of genuine warmth that no luxury hotel can manufacture.\n\nDid you know that Kudremukh gets its intriguing name from two local words? \"Kudre\" means \"horse\" and \"Mukha\" means \"face\" - a nod to the peak that strikingly resembles a horse's face.\n\nMy plan was simple: nothing at all. Just exist in this place, breathe deeply, and reset.\n\n---\n\nThat evening, restlessness pulled me outdoors for a stroll. A friendly local taxi driver from Mysore offered me a lift, carrying me a couple of kilometers down the road while we chatted about life and wildlife. Though he hadn't spotted any of the park's famous residents lately, his stories made the forest around us feel alive with possibilities.\n\nI found a small suspension bridge spanning a gentle stream - the perfect spot to sit for half an hour, listening to water murmuring over stones while birds called their evening messages. Later, at a tiny village shop, I sipped a local soda and watched the day's light begin to fade.\n\nThe walk back was unexpectedly challenging - an uphill trek that had me regretting my casual downhill stroll. No passing cars meant no lifts this time. By 7:00 PM, sweaty and satisfied, I returned to my homestay for a simple dinner before falling into the deep, dreamless sleep that only physical exertion can bring.\n\n### An Unexpected Friendship\nMorning brought new energy and the itch to explore. I decided to visit a nearby waterfall, firing up my V-Strom for another ride through paradise. Along the way, I spotted a solo traveler walking in the same direction. Something made me stop - perhaps the universal recognition of another soul traveling alone.\n\n> \"Need a lift?\"\nI called out.\n\nAfter explaining I was headed to Soormane waterfall, he introduced himself as Atul from Himachal Pradesh. Recently relocated to Bangalore, this was his first solo adventure in the south. There's something about motorcycles and mountains that breaks down barriers - within minutes, we were talking like old friends.\n\nThe waterfall required a short downhill trek through dense forest. When we arrived, the scene was almost comically perfect: crystal clear water cascading into a natural pool, surrounded by verdant green, and completely empty save for a couple finishing up their pre-wedding photoshoot against nature's spectacular backdrop.\n\nOnce we had the place to ourselves, we settled into a peaceful rhythm. We sat by the water, casually chatting and enjoying the tranquility. I pulled out my copy of \"The Richest Man in Babylon\" while Atul explored the surroundings. For 40 minutes, we enjoyed the luxury of a natural paradise shared without awkwardness - a rare connection between two strangers.\n\nLearning Atul needed accommodation, I mentioned the homestay. By evening, he had secured a room at the same place, and our parallel journeys had officially converged.\n\nThat same evening, Atul and I took my bike to a nearby viewpoint where the landscape unfolded before us like a living painting. Atul's company was refreshingly unpretentious - \"He doesn't take himself too seriously,\" as I noted to myself.\n\nLater, we met a relative of our homestay owner who joined our conversation, painting the region's history with his words. He explained how the local economy revolved around tobacco and coffee cultivation, the challenges of living within a protected forest, and the changing rhythms of life in Kudremukh over generations.\n\nAs dinner wound down, he casually asked if we'd like to join him for a trek the following morning. I hesitated - I was supposed to leave for Bangalore the next day, and responsibilities were calling. But looking at the mountains surrounding us, I made a decision that travelers rarely regret: plans can wait.\n\n### The Final Adventure\n\nDawn found us ready for adventure, dew still clinging to tall grass as we began our climb at 6:30 AM. The path was steep and unforgiving, especially for my desk-job legs. While Atul and our guide bounded upward like mountain goats, I puffed behind them, grateful for their patience as they waited for me at various points.\n\n> \"Like a tortoise,\" \n\nI joked about myself, though there was nothing slow about the beating of my heart.\n\nMidway up, our guide pointed out a natural spring. \"Pure,\" he said, as we filled our bottles with water that tasted like nothing and everything at once. He also mentioned, with a conspiratorial smile, that we were technically in a restricted area requiring permits. \"If anyone asks, you're my relatives,\" he instructed with a wink.\n\nThe summit rewarded our efforts with winds that nearly knocked us over and views that certainly knocked us speechless. Mountains rolled away in every direction, their horse-shaped ridges explaining the name \"Kudremukh\" (horse face). Despite the sunshine, the wind chilled our sweat-soaked clothes, limiting our stay to a brief but profound 20 minutes of silent appreciation.\n\n\nThe descent brought its own challenges - dewy grass creating nature's slip-and-slide. My pride suffered more than my body through several ungraceful falls, but laughter eased the journey down.\n\nOur guide's final act of hospitality was an invitation to his modest home, where hot tea never tasted so good. When Atul tried to offer a small token of appreciation with the words, \n\n> \"We came to your house for the first time and didn't even bring sweets, this is a small gift from us\"\n\nOur guide refused with gentle indignation. Instead, he asked for our contact details \"for when I visit Bangalore.\" In an age of transactional tourism, his genuine connection to travelers felt like a precious artifact from another time.\n\n### The Return\nWith reluctance and a bike packed with luggage and memories, I pointed my V-Strom back toward Bengaluru around mid-morning. The return journey was smooth but contemplative, my mind replaying moments from a trip that had delivered far more than I'd anticipated.\n\nAs I pulled into Bengaluru's familiar chaos at 4:30 PM, I realized I'd experienced something increasingly rare in our hyperconnected world - authentic adventure with room for serendipity. What began as a solo journey had gifted me a new friendship, an unexpected trek, and the reminder that sometimes the best experiences lie just beyond our original plans.\n\nMy Suzuki V-Strom had covered nearly 700 kilometers over those few days, but the distance traveled in spirit felt immeasurably greater.\n\nHave you ever set out alone only to find unexpected connections along the way? Perhaps there's something magical about solo travel that actually opens us up to deeper human encounters. My Kudremukh journey certainly suggests so.","src/content/blog/kudremukh-ride.md","08be66c8862903ed",{"html":590,"metadata":591},"\u003Cp>There’s something deeply liberating about hitting the open road on two wheels, with nothing but your thoughts and the endless horizon for company.
