The morning I was supposed to leave for Goa, I discovered my motorcycle's tire was punctured. Just my luck. What should have been a quick start turned into a two-hour delay as I hunted for a repair shop. The whole process was frustrating - first they had to open the tire, which was a process in itself, and then actually fix the puncture. Two different problems, double the time.

While waiting, I grabbed some breakfast at a nearby stall - misal pav and chai. The spicy mixture paired with the bread and hot tea was delicious, but it did little to improve my mood. I was already running late for what was going to be a challenging 530-kilometer ride.

When I finally hit the road, things only got worse. The roads were in terrible condition, with construction stretching for almost 350 kilometers from the start. My bike rattled over uneven surfaces, and I had to ride at a snail's pace to avoid damaging it further. At one point, I stopped at a petrol pump hoping to refill and freshen up, only to discover they had neither water nor petrol. The attendant saw my defeated expression and offered what seemed like a ray of hope.

"After 20 kilometers, the roads will be good for the rest of your journey," he promised.

And surprisingly, he was right. Once I passed that 20-kilometer mark, the roads transformed into smooth highways. But those first 350 kilometers had taken their toll. The sun beat down mercilessly on my motorcycle, and at one point, I had to pour water over my riding gears to prevent them from overheating - a desperate measure that I'd never imagined having to take.

I finally reached Goa around 7 in the evening, exhausted and sore. By the time I checked into the Hostel, it was already 8 PM. A whole day spent mostly fighting bad roads and the scorching sun.

## First Night Struggles

The room I'd booked turned out to be non-AC, a detail I hadn't paid much attention to while booking. But the humid Goan air quickly made it clear that sleeping without air conditioning would be impossible. I approached the manager, who agreed to shift me to an AC room for an additional 450 rupees per night. For four nights, it was an expense I hadn't planned for, but comfort won over budget.

Too tired to venture out for food, I ordered from Zomato and collapsed onto the bed as soon as I'd eaten. The long journey and all its complications had drained every ounce of energy from me.

## Ozran Beach: Not What I Expected

The next morning, feeling somewhat refreshed, I decided to check out Ozran Beach, which was conveniently located just 500 meters from the hostel. The proximity was the only positive aspect of the experience, as it turned out.

I sat on the sand for a few hours, trying to enjoy the beach atmosphere, but it was hard to relax with so much going on around me. At one point, I witnessed a parent harshly scolding his child in public, yelling at him because the kid wanted to go back to the hotel. The scene made me uncomfortable - the poor child looked embarrassed and scared.

The sunset was admittedly beautiful, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink. But even this moment of natural beauty was tainted by the excessive noise from the numerous beach cafes. Music blared from competing speakers, and crowds of tourists shouted over the din. It was far from the peaceful beach experience I had imagined.

## North Goa: Party Central

Before my trip, everyone had recommended North Goa for its vibrant party scene and music. "You'll love it," they'd said. But I've never been much of a party person - I can usually adapt and find something to enjoy, but North Goa's intensity pushed even my flexible limits. The constant noise, crowds, and party atmosphere quickly became overwhelming. As a result, I spent most of my time indoors at the hostel, which wasn't how I'd planned to experience Goa.

## Chapora Fort and Souvenirs

Later that day, I visited Chapora Fort, more popularly known as the "Dil Chahta Hai Fort" after the famous Bollywood movie shot there. The view from the top was genuinely breathtaking - vast stretches of sea on one side and lush greenery on the other. This was more like the Goa I had imagined.

While there, I picked up souvenirs - a fridge magnet for myself and a shankh (conch shell) for my father. At least I'd have something tangible to remember this trip by.

On the way back, I stopped at Dominos and treated myself to a pizza. It wasn't authentic Goan cuisine, but at that point, I was craving something familiar and reliable.

The highlight of my Goa trip wasn't the beaches or the famous landmarks, but the people I met - particularly Nikunj. An entrepreneur who specialized in building swimming pools for clients, Nikunj could construct a complete pool in just four days, a fact he mentioned with well-deserved pride.

Our morning trip to Candolim Beach had been his idea, the sunrise was indeed spectacular, golden light spreading across the horizon and reflecting off the water. But even at this early hour, the beach was far from empty. Tourists were already setting up for the day, joggers ran along the shoreline, and vendors were preparing their stalls. The crowds were a stark contrast to what I had imagined a morning beach visit would be like.

After our beach visit, he insisted on paying for my breakfast, waving away my protests with a casual, "Next time you can get it."

He was the kind of chilled-out guy who made no demands and expected nothing in return for his friendship. In a trip filled with disappointments and frustrations, meeting someone like him was a unexpected bright spot.

As I packed up to leave North Goa, I couldn't help but feel that the place hadn't lived up to my expectations. The beaches were overcrowded, the party scene wasn't for me, and the journey there had been more challenging than enjoyable. But I had met Nikunj, seen a beautiful sunrise, and collected a couple of souvenirs. Perhaps that was enough for now. Maybe someday I'd return to this part of Goa and give it a proper chance it deserved.
