## The Unexpected Beginning

After six weeks of cruising along India's western coastline, I was eager to continue my motorcycle adventure from Pune to Mumbai. The morning held promise — clear skies, my trusty bike prepped and ready, and the excitement of exploring Maharashtra's crown jewel. Little did I know that my journey would begin with an unexpected hiccup.

Just as I was about to embark, I discovered my tire had punctured. Not the auspicious start I had imagined! Instead of hitting the highway, I found myself searching for a mechanic. The repair cost me a whopping 2,200 rupees — the tire itself needed patching as it was damaged, not just the tube. The mechanic discovered and fixed four separate punctures in the tube. An expensive setback, but essential to continue my journey safely.

## Navigating Construction Chaos

With my motorcycle finally roadworthy again, I set off toward Mumbai, only to face another challenge — the roads were a labyrinth of confusion. Construction work dominated the route, with detours and temporary paths making navigation a test of patience. Road signs appeared and disappeared among the maze of machinery and diverted traffic.

During one particularly confusing stretch, I stopped at a petrol pump, parched and desperate for water. When I asked for a glass, the employee apologetically explained they couldn't keep glasses out — "People steal them," he said, offering me his personal water bottle instead. This small act of kindness among the chaos of construction dust and blaring horns reminded me why I love road trips — these genuine human connections that emerge in unexpected places.

## Accommodation Adventures

By late afternoon, I finally reached my pre-booked hotel in Mumbai, only to discover it was far from what the online photos had promised. Old, dirty, and generally uninviting, I decided immediately this wouldn't be my resting place. Thankfully, a friend offered their place for the evening, giving me breathing room to find proper accommodation.

The next day, I went hotel-hunting in person rather than trusting online listings. I found a decent place for 1,500 rupees per day — nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable, which was all I needed after weeks on the road.

## Three Days of Exploration

For the next three days, I enjoyed exploring the surrounding areas. One morning, I rode to what was marked as a waterfall on the highway. Amusingly, there wasn't a drop of water to be seen, but the spot near Hazrat Fakir Shah Baba Darbar on NH 48 offered a surprisingly good viewpoint overlooking the highway. I spent a peaceful morning there, watching traffic flow like a river of metal and color below.

## The Challenging Return

The ride from Kalyan to Locomo Hostel tested my patience like nothing else on my six-week journey. What should have been a 60-kilometer trip stretched into a three-hour ordeal through Mumbai's unforgiving traffic. The last kilometer alone took 45 minutes to navigate — a perfect microcosm of Mumbai's traffic situation.

During this crawl through congested streets, I found myself alongside an older gentleman on a scooter. We chatted briefly about the traffic, the weather, and the general state of Mumbai's roads. Before filtering ahead, he offered a simple "all the best for your journey" — a small encouragement that somehow made the remaining traffic more bearable.

## Locomo Hostel: A Rider's Haven

After my hotel stay, I switched to Locomo Hostel for four days — a decision that enriched my Mumbai experience significantly. The hostel had dedicated motorcycle parking, which any rider knows is worth its weight in gold in a crowded city like Mumbai. Their rooftop featured a lovely grass area where guests gathered in the evenings, and the automated lighting systems throughout gave the place a modern feel.

I slept in a ten-person dorm that was thoughtfully designed — each bed had its own fan and a secure storage space for belongings. After weeks of varying accommodation quality on the road, these small comforts felt luxurious.

## Meaningful Encounters

The true highlight of Locomo wasn't the amenities but the people. I was delighted to run into Uday Pratap, whom I'd previously met in Gokarna earlier in my journey. We celebrated our reunion with masala lemon ginger tea, though we agreed it wasn't particularly impressive.

One evening, I had a fascinating conversation with a gentleman who had joined his company as a trainee and eventually retired as its CEO. His career journey spanning decades offered a perspective on professional growth that you can't find in business books.

I also met a second-year college student buzzing with entrepreneurial energy. He was adamant about starting his own venture rather than "working for others," and was methodically gathering experiences and insights from fellow travelers. Interestingly, he held skeptical views about cryptocurrency, preferring to focus on more traditional business models.

## Exploring Mumbai's Landmarks

Despite Mumbai's notorious traffic, I strategically planned my sightseeing. When staying near Kalyan, I used my motorcycle, but otherwise relied on the city's efficient train system. The UTS app became my best friend — providing ridiculously cheap tickets for timely trains.

I visited Marine Drive, feeling the sea breeze that felt distinctly different from the coastal winds I'd experienced elsewhere on my journey. The Hanging Garden offered a welcome respite from urban chaos — divided into two sections on either side of the road, it made for a refreshing morning walk. I couldn't help noticing an impressively rotund dog lounging there, and the whimsical giant shoe house that seemed to delight every child who passed it.

## Street Observations

Sometimes a road-weary traveler just needs to sit and observe. Before catching my train back to the hostel, I enjoyed a surprisingly refreshing 5-rupee lemon water from a street vendor — proving again that price and quality don't always correlate.

## Culinary Experiences

Mumbai's food scene offered mixed experiences. Near CST station, I discovered delicious parotta with kadala curry that transported my taste buds straight to Kerala. Less impressive was a "nachos burger" from a burger joint that seemed to have misunderstood the concept of what constitutes "nachos."

## Final Mumbai Memories

Before departing for Surat — the next stop on my west coast tour — I attempted a food pilgrimage for Mumbai's famous pav bhaji. Unfortunately, the recommended place had either moved or closed, leaving me with an unfulfilled culinary quest. Sometimes, even the best-planned adventures leave loose ends that beckon you to return someday.

In the quietness of my hostel dorm that last night, reflecting on my Mumbai experience, I realized how the initial tire puncture had set the tone for my entire stay — unexpected, occasionally frustrating, but ultimately revealing the city's character through its challenges rather than despite them.

## An Invitation to Fellow Riders

For those planning their own motorcycle journey through Mumbai, I offer this hard-earned advice: embrace the chaos, budget extra time for traffic (and then add more), and consider train travel for inner-city exploration. The dedicated parking at Locomo Hostel makes it worth considering for riders, and the connections you'll make with fellow travelers might just be the highlight of your Mumbai experience.
