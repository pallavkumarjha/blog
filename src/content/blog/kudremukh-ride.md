There's something deeply liberating about hitting the open road on two wheels, with nothing but your thoughts and the endless horizon for company. This is the story of how I set out alone on my Suzuki V-Strom SX toward Kudremukh National Park, only to discover that sometimes the best journeys bring unexpected companions.

## The Journey Begins

Somewhere in last week of December last year, with Bengaluru's morning traffic still yawning behind me, I pointed my bike south and twisted the throttle. The bike responded eagerly, as if it too had been waiting for this escape from the city's relentless rhythm.

The journey began smoothly enough - 280 kilometers of relatively straight highways under a bright sunny sky, the kind of riding that lets your mind wander while your body settles into the mechanical meditation of long-distance motorcycling. But it was the final 60 kilometers that made my heart race. The road transformed into a serpentine delight, winding through the foothills of the Western Ghats. Each curve invited a perfect lean, each straightaway a moment to admire the increasingly lush surroundings. For riders, these are the roads we dream about.

Sometimes travel plans unravel, only to reweave themselves into something better. My original accommodation fell through, but fate had better ideas. I found myself at a humble homestay nestled within Kudremukh National Park itself - a simple place charging ₹1,300 per night including meals, but offering million-dollar views from every window. The host welcomed me with the kind of genuine warmth that no luxury hotel can manufacture.

Did you know that Kudremukh gets its intriguing name from two local words? "Kudre" means "horse" and "Mukha" means "face" - a nod to the peak that strikingly resembles a horse's face.

My plan was simple: nothing at all. Just exist in this place, breathe deeply, and reset.

That evening, restlessness pulled me outdoors for a stroll. A friendly local taxi driver from Mysore offered me a lift, carrying me a couple of kilometers down the road while we chatted about life and wildlife. Though he hadn't spotted any of the park's famous residents lately, his stories made the forest around us feel alive with possibilities.

I found a small suspension bridge spanning a gentle stream - the perfect spot to sit for half an hour, listening to water murmuring over stones while birds called their evening messages. Later, at a tiny village shop, I sipped a local soda and watched the day's light begin to fade.

The walk back was unexpectedly challenging - an uphill trek that had me regretting my casual downhill stroll. No passing cars meant no lifts this time. By 7:00 PM, sweaty and satisfied, I returned to my homestay for a simple dinner before falling into the deep, dreamless sleep that only physical exertion can bring.

### An Unexpected Friendship
Morning brought new energy and the itch to explore. I decided to visit a nearby waterfall, firing up my V-Strom for another ride through paradise. Along the way, I spotted a solo traveler walking in the same direction. Something made me stop - perhaps the universal recognition of another soul traveling alone.

> "Need a lift?"
I called out.

After explaining I was headed to Soormane waterfall, he introduced himself as Atul from Himachal Pradesh. Recently relocated to Bangalore, this was his first solo adventure in the south. There's something about motorcycles and mountains that breaks down barriers - within minutes, we were talking like old friends.

The waterfall required a short downhill trek through dense forest. When we arrived, the scene was almost comically perfect: crystal clear water cascading into a natural pool, surrounded by verdant green, and completely empty save for a couple finishing up their pre-wedding photoshoot against nature's spectacular backdrop.

Once we had the place to ourselves, we settled into a peaceful rhythm. We sat by the water, casually chatting and enjoying the tranquility. I pulled out my copy of "The Richest Man in Babylon" while Atul explored the surroundings. For 40 minutes, we enjoyed the luxury of a natural paradise shared without awkwardness - a rare connection between two strangers.

Learning Atul needed accommodation, I mentioned the homestay. By evening, he had secured a room at the same place, and our parallel journeys had officially converged.

That same evening, Atul and I took my bike to a nearby viewpoint where the landscape unfolded before us like a living painting. Atul's company was refreshingly unpretentious - "He doesn't take himself too seriously," as I noted to myself.

Later, we met a relative of our homestay owner who joined our conversation, painting the region's history with his words. He explained how the local economy revolved around tobacco and coffee cultivation, the challenges of living within a protected forest, and the changing rhythms of life in Kudremukh over generations.

As dinner wound down, he casually asked if we'd like to join him for a trek the following morning. I hesitated - I was supposed to leave for Bangalore the next day, and responsibilities were calling. But looking at the mountains surrounding us, I made a decision that travelers rarely regret: plans can wait.

### The Final Adventure

Dawn found us ready for adventure, dew still clinging to tall grass as we began our climb at 6:30 AM. The path was steep and unforgiving, especially for my desk-job legs. While Atul and our guide bounded upward like mountain goats, I puffed behind them, grateful for their patience as they waited for me at various points.

> "Like a tortoise," 

I joked about myself, though there was nothing slow about the beating of my heart.

Midway up, our guide pointed out a natural spring. "Pure," he said, as we filled our bottles with water that tasted like nothing and everything at once. He also mentioned, with a conspiratorial smile, that we were technically in a restricted area requiring permits. "If anyone asks, you're my relatives," he instructed with a wink.

The summit rewarded our efforts with winds that nearly knocked us over and views that certainly knocked us speechless. Mountains rolled away in every direction, their horse-shaped ridges explaining the name "Kudremukh" (horse face). Despite the sunshine, the wind chilled our sweat-soaked clothes, limiting our stay to a brief but profound 20 minutes of silent appreciation.


The descent brought its own challenges - dewy grass creating nature's slip-and-slide. My pride suffered more than my body through several ungraceful falls, but laughter eased the journey down.

Our guide's final act of hospitality was an invitation to his modest home, where hot tea never tasted so good. When Atul tried to offer a small token of appreciation with the words, 

> "We came to your house for the first time and didn't even bring sweets, this is a small gift from us"

Our guide refused with gentle indignation. Instead, he asked for our contact details "for when I visit Bangalore." In an age of transactional tourism, his genuine connection to travelers felt like a precious artifact from another time.

### The Return
With reluctance and a bike packed with luggage and memories, I pointed my V-Strom back toward Bengaluru around mid-morning. The return journey was smooth but contemplative, my mind replaying moments from a trip that had delivered far more than I'd anticipated.

As I pulled into Bengaluru's familiar chaos at 4:30 PM, I realized I'd experienced something increasingly rare in our hyperconnected world - authentic adventure with room for serendipity. What began as a solo journey had gifted me a new friendship, an unexpected trek, and the reminder that sometimes the best experiences lie just beyond our original plans.

My Suzuki V-Strom had covered nearly 700 kilometers over those few days, but the distance traveled in spirit felt immeasurably greater.

Have you ever set out alone only to find unexpected connections along the way? Perhaps there's something magical about solo travel that actually opens us up to deeper human encounters. My Kudremukh journey certainly suggests so.
