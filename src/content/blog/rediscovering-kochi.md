After leaving Kanyakumari on my bike, I set out for Kochi. This place brought back past memories. This is the place where I first rode a two-wheeler and explored parts of Kerala(Allepey and Munnar). This is also where I had a crazy scooter mishap but came out unscathed, unlike my friend who got a tiny scratch on his knee. He still teases me about it, saying I jinxed his beach plans!

## The Journey

The journey from Kanyakumari to Kochi was quite challenging. I was traveling on NH66, which in itself was quite a task. There were no dividers throughout the 450 km that I rode, and on top of that, drivers were careless to say the least. It took me around 15 hours to reach.

That day, I just wanted to chill, skip the Bosco (motorcycle), and relax with a bath and a nap. Traveling solo can be tough sometimes, and you just wish for a break. But hey, no escaping it; gotta keep rolling, or you'll end up stuck in the middle of nowhere.

I passed through Varkala on my way north, and boy, what a sight! Didn't even know the name at first, just got lost in its beauty and those serene backwaters. It's like a magnet for travelers now, which explains the pricey snacks — I almost had to mortgage my bike for a snack!

On the way I saw a lot of churches, and the architecture reminded me of Portuguese influence.

## Arrival and Accommodation

I reached Kochi around 9 in the evening. I parked my bike, took a cold shower, and went to sleep.

The next morning, I was able to admire the city and my accommodation. I was staying at Zostel; this was not my first time staying in a hostel, but it had been a while. I was a little bit nervous about the people I would meet there.

I was paying around 500 INR/day, and I had it booked for a week, which was reasonable, now that I think about it. These days, Zostel's prices are skyrocketing. My room was a cozy four-seater with two sets of bunk beds.

I had the pleasure of meeting Joseph during my stay in the hostel. He was the caretaker and a local guide to whoever was staying in the hostel. He happily shared some insider tips for exploring Fort Kochi.

## Tale of Two Cities

Kochi is like that friend who can't decide if they want to chill or party.

It's divided into two parts: the main city and Fort Kochi. The main city? Well, it's your typical busy, bustling urban scene. The only gem in this concrete jungle is Marine Drive, where you can catch a stunning sunset while bobbing on a boat.

Imagine Fort Kochi: towering trees, cozy cafes, and spacious parks. The evenings there are like a dream, wandering from one narrow lane to the next. So peaceful, laid-back, and full of charm!

I wish I had a picture. Somehow I was too busy doing nothing here.

So, if you're a traveler looking for a place to crash in Kochi, consider staying in the main city… just kidding! Fort Kochi is where the real magic happens.
