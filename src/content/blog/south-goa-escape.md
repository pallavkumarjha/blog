## Leaving North Goa: Wrong Turns and Quiet Roads

The morning I left North Goa, the sun was still stretching its golden fingers over the horizon. Nikunj had insisted I call him before leaving, so I did - only to find he was perched atop the Dil Chahta Hai fort, soaking in one last view. "Five minutes," he promised, and true to his word, he roared back on his bike, grinning through the dust. We hugged goodbye, a quick, sunlit moment between two strangers turned temporary companions. "Don't let South Goa disappoint you" he joked. I shrugged. After the chaos of the north, I was ready for quiet.

The ride south started smoothly, until I missed an exit and found myself on a flyover leading nowhere. Panic flickered, but I laughed it off - classic me- and doubled back. The detour felt symbolic, like Goa itself was testing my patience.

When I finally reached the hostel, it was nothing like Footloose. No blaring music, no crowds. Just a sleepy compound where parrots squawked in coconut trees. My room wasn't ready, so I sat cross-legged under a frangipani tree, laptop balanced on my knees, dialing into a work meeting. The irony wasn't lost on me: here I was, "working" while vacationing in paradise.

## South Goa's Whispering Beaches

South Goa unfolded slowly, like a secret. That afternoon, I wandered to Palolem Beach, where the sand curved like a crescent moon and the sea glowed turquoise. I stayed until sunset, watching the sky bleed into pinks and purples. For dinner, I ate at a shack lit by fairy lights, savoring grilled panner and salad, as the waiter shrugged, "No Zomato here, sir. Only real food."

The next morning, I chased solitude to Galgibaga Beach. It was empty, except for an elderly man collecting shells. He nodded at me, then vanished, leaving me alone with the waves. Later, I followed a dirt path to where a river kissed the sea, sitting for hours in the quiet. At a nearby caf√©, I sipped chai from a clay cup, its earthy bitterness grounding me.

The roads here felt familiar - NH66, the same highway I'd ridden from Kanyakumari to Surat weeks earlier. Now, it carried me back toward Bengaluru, weaving through jungles and past villages where kids waved at my bike.

That evening, I stumbled upon a cliffside viewpoint, all jagged rocks and endless ocean. A Dutch couple sat nearby, holding hands. We didn't speak, but their quiet companionship mirrored the peace I'd found here.

## Dudhsagar Falls and the Fear of Letting Go

Dudhsagar Falls had always been a dream. The ride there was magic - a winding road dappled with sunlight, flanked by forests so thick they swallowed sound. I stopped for samosas at a roadside stall, the spices sharp on my tongue, before joining a shared taxi to the falls.

The hike was short but steep, and when I finally saw it - white water thundering into an emerald pool - my breath caught. I was the first one there. For 10 minutes, the falls belonged to me. I dipped my toes in, but the water was icy, and the fish darting near my feet made me flinch. "Coward", I thought, laughing at myself. I vowed to return after learning to swim, though part of me wondered if I ever would.

Back at the hostel, I met Nidhi. She was sitting alone in the common area, typing furiously on her laptop. "Workation?" I asked, nodding at her screen. She groaned, "Marketing never stops." We clicked instantly - her dry humor, my restless energy. When she mentioned it was her birthday, I raised an eyebrow. "And you're working?" She smirked. "Don't tell anyone. I hate fuss."

## Birthday Cakes and Goodbyes

That evening, Nidhi and I rode to Cabo de Rama, an ancient fort crumbling into the sea. We sat on the cliffs, sharing stories as the wind tugged at our hair. She'd extended her Goa trip twice, she said, "because adulthood is just a series of deadlines anyway."

The next morning, I packed my bags early. Shekhar, a talkative techie from Bengaluru, stopped by to chat about his startup. Abhimanyu, an introverted coder, nodded goodbye from his hammock. These fleeting connections - Nikunj's easy kindness, Nidhi's rebellious joy, even Shekhar's endless chatter - stitched themselves into my memory.

## The Quiet After the Storm

As I was riding back home, highway humming beneath me, I thought about the Goas I'd seen: the noisy, the serene, the disappointing, the sublime. South Goa hadn't fixed everything - I still hadn't learned to swim, still hated crowded beaches - but it gave me something better.

It gave me empty shorelines at dawn, a Dutch couple's silent solidarity, and Nidhi's cake-smudged smile. It gave me the courage to sit still in quiet places, to say yes to adventures, to laugh at wrong turns.

Paradise isn't a postcard. It's cold water fears and birthday candles lit in secret. It's the people who flicker into your life, brief and bright, reminding you that sometimes the best journeys aren't about the places - they're about who you become along the way.

## The Final Stretch: A Journey Within a Journey

The last leg of my trip began before 4 AM next day, the world still cloaked in darkness. This would be my longest day. 630kms. I wanted to beat the traffic and reach Bengaluru by evening, but Goa had one last challenge in store for me. Around 5 AM, my tyre got punctured in the middle of nowhere - a sunsaan ilaka with no signs of life. I rode in first gear for a while, the bike limping along until I stumbled upon a small village.

I stopped at a tea stall run by Shetty uncle, a kind-faced man who shook his head when I asked for help. "The puncture guy ran away," he said, chuckling. "Won't be back today." I called Royal Enfield's Road side assistance service, but it was Sunday, and no one answered. Shetty uncle pointed me to another puncture shop 2 kilometers away.

I offloaded all my luggage at his stall and rode to the shop, only to be turned away because the mechanic didn't know how to handle disc brakes. He filled my tyre with air and sent me off to find a mechanic. After a fruitless search, I returned, determined to fix it myself.

It took me an hour to remove the wheel, and three times I almost gave up, convinced I couldn't do it. But finally, I managed to get it off, handed it to the puncture guy, and waited as he fixed it. Putting the wheel back was another battle, but I refused to quit. By the time I was done, my hands were greasy, and my patience was frayed, but I felt a strange sense of pride.

Back at Shetty uncle's stall, I had breakfast, packed my luggage, and hit the road again. The rest of the ride was smooth - no hiccups, just open roads and the hum of my bike. I stopped for lunch at a roadside dhaba, savoring dal and tandoori roti, before pushing on toward Bengaluru.

As I reached the outskirts of the city, the sun began to dip below the horizon. My house was just 2 kilometers away when it hit me - the sheer magnitude of what I'd accomplished. Tears welled up, a mix of exhaustion, happiness, and pride. I had done it.

When I finally pulled into my driveway, I was greeted by my bhaiya and bhabhi, their smiles wide and welcoming. Home had never felt sweeter.
