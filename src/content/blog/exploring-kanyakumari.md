This article is the continuation of my [previous post](/blog/ride-to-starting-point) about reaching Kanyakumari. If you haven't read it yet, I recommend checking it out first.

## First Impressions

After an exhaustive two-day journey covering nearly 800 kilometers from Bengaluru, I finally arrived in Kanyakumari on the evening of February 12th. The fatigue from the continuous travel was weighing heavily on me. Kanyakumari, despite its fame, is not a sprawling town. It stretches merely 4-5 kilometers from one end to the beach. As I made my way towards my hotel, I couldn't help but notice the curious stares from the locals. It was evident that bikers like me were a rarity in this part of India.

I checked into Hotel Raja Palace, which turned out to be quite affordable at just 500 rupees per night. Although the room lacked modern conveniences like Wi-Fi and AC, its economical price and close proximity to the main beach road, a mere 500 meters away, made it a practical choice.

## The Initial Disappointment

After taking a refreshing shower and collapsing onto the bed, I finally managed to gather some energy. It was around 7 PM, and with a sense of anticipation, I stepped out to explore the town.

To my surprise, the streets were teeming with people. Buses, tourist taxis, cars, motorcycles, and what not. Roadside shops and vendors lined the streets, offering an array of snacks, fried fish, toys, shells, and various trinkets. The bustling scene left me feeling disheartened.

I had hoped to discover a place that was less crowded and more quiet, but the reality was quite the opposite. As I walked along the main beach road, there were no empty benches to sit on, no place to stand still and no one to talk to.

I thought to myself,

"Should I go back to Bengaluru? Was this a mistake to come here and explore all alone?"

The initial excitement I had felt now wavered in the face of the overwhelming crowd and noise.

## A Failed Adventure

Brushing off these thoughts, I decided to consult Google Maps in search of a calm spot to gather my thoughts. It pointed me towards Kanyakumari pier, a place that looked good at least in photos. However, as I made my way towards it, my doubts started to intensify.

The path leading to the pier was dimly lit, with an eerie atmosphere. It was unkempt and gave off a sense of neglect.

Reluctantly, I turned back, feeling disheartened by the turn of events. All I wanted at that moment was to find a cozy place to have dinner and retreat to the comfort of my room.

## An Unexpected Encounter

As I finished my average dinner at one of the local dhabas, I left for my hotel. Just before reaching, a small tea shop caught my attention, and I decided to pause for a cup of tea. While the Anna diligently prepared my tea, I instinctively reached for my phone, hoping to discover any hidden gems in the area.

To my surprise, an auto-rickshaw driver, who happened to be enjoying his own tea at the shop, struck up a conversation.

"Tourist?"

"Na, traveler."

"Did you like Kanyakumari?"

"Na, it is so much crowded. I am thinking to go back."

"Wait one more day sir. It will look different. Today is Sunday."

Little did I know, Kanyakumari had a unique identity beyond its charm as a tourist spot. It is primarily known as a pilgrimage site, drawing devotees from far and wide, especially on weekends, to pay homage at the sacred temple.

The auto-rickshaw driver's explanation shed light on the origin of the bustling crowds that had flooded the town. It became apparent that my initial disappointment came from an unawareness of the town's true essence.

## Hidden Gems

Our conversation continued:

"How do you know Hindi so well? People here barely understand Hindi."

"I was in the middle east for couple of years, had to work with people from all over India, hence had to learn Hindi."

"Do you know any good places nearby?"

"How are you traveling?"

"I have a bike."

"Nice, wait I will show you few places in my phone. For how many days will you stay here?"

"One week."

Then he told me about few beaches which looked great in photos. He made sure I wrote down everything, along with its google map location so that I do not forget.

Apparently most of them were not visited by tourists as they were not aware of them. It was little bit far from the main town.

Here are the places he recommended, which you should definitely try to visit when you're in town:

- Vattakotai beach
- Chothavilai beach
- Lemur beach
- Padmanabhapuram Palace
- Mathoor Aqueduct
- Tirparappu Water Falls (Too much crowd, left in few mins)
- Poovar (Did not go because of time constraint)

## What's Next?

With an exciting itinerary and a comprehensive list of must-see places, I was eager to explore. However, amidst all the exploration, there was one place that stood out from the rest â€” Capeista Cafe. A special haven that I vowed to visit every time I find myself in Kanyakumari. About this and much more in the next article.
