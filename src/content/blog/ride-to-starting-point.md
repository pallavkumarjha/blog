This article is the continuation of [last](/blog/day-1-beginning-the-journey) article, so if you are unaware of my background, do give it a read.

## A Night in Madurai

I crashed on the bed feeling exhausted after navigating through narrow streets, avoiding potholes and cows en route to the hotel in Madurai. My plan was to spend only a night before zooming off early morning towards my destination Kanyakumari. In the night I got a call from one of my friend who asked me to visit Meenakshi Temple. I had no intention to visit initially but then I thought let's give it a visit.

After checking into the modest hotel, I asked for dinner recommendations from the helper. He offered to get me food of any cuisine I preferred. I opted for vegetarian food and handed him the money. To my surprise, he returned with chicken noodles, forcing me to remind him that I had asked for vegetarian food. He made a funny face (ðŸ˜…) and apologized before quickly getting me delicious veg noodles instead. The hospitality in this town really amazed me.

## An Unexpected Temple Visit

Next day when I tied my luggage on the bike, I put the destination as Meenakshi temple on my phone.

I navigated towards the temple passing through crowded streets of Madurai. Finally I was in the vicinity of the temple. It was a short 12km ride from my hotel.

I came to a halt on the street, contemplating whether to leave or not, when suddenly a policewoman caught my attention with her call. I was scared. ðŸ˜‚

When I turned around she asked me the same set of questions which everyone asked me:

She: "Where are you coming from?"
Me: "Bengaluru."
She: "On bike?"
Me: "Yes, started yesterday morning and reached yesterday evening."
She: "Haaaaaaâ€¦. ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±"
She: "No back pain?"
Me: "No, It is a habit now." (Trying to look cool, when I have barely done 450+ km in a day ðŸ˜œ)
She: "How did parents give you permission?"
Me: "With a lot of difficult conversations."
She: "Hahahahaâ€¦"
She: "Going inside?"
Me: "Yes." (I couldn't say noðŸ™ˆ)

I approached the lady near the temple and politely asked, "Excuse me, would it be possible to keep my helmet in your cabin while I go inside?" She kindly agreed, and I left my helmet with her before entering the peaceful sanctuary.

Although I'm not typically drawn to religious destinations, this temple was different. As I stood before the ornate gates, I found myself meditating for a full 10 minutes. It was the calmest I had ever felt. However, as I hadn't bathed, I chose not to enter and instead turned back at the gate.

## The Journey to Kanyakumari

Once I retrieved my helmet, I set off on my bike towards Kanyakumari, feeling excited to reach this milestone location. Since my childhood and teenage years, I had read so much about it being the southernmost point of India, closest to the equator, and much more.

The ride to Kanyakumari was going smoothly until I heard a loud "clang" while cruising along the road at 80kmph. Worried, I stopped my bike and realized that my bike's battery cover had fallen off along the way. Despite searching around for it, the cover was nowhere to be found, and I knew I had to let it go.

The roads leading up to Kanyakumari were breathtaking, with windmills on both sides of the highway. I later learned that Tamil Nadu is home to India's largest windmill farm, producing over 1500MW of energy.

## First Impressions of Kanyakumari

As the sun started setting, I finally arrived at Kanyakumari and checked into my hotel. Concerned about the missing cover, I attempted to reach out to the Royal Enfield service centre but failed to get any response from them. Nevertheless, I decided to make the most of my trip and explore the beautiful sights that lay ahead.

In the late evening after taking a good nap, I went out to see Kanyakumari town, and man was I disappointed.

So much crowd. Lots and lots of people everywhere and not a single good beach.

I thought to myself, "where am I? Is this what I was looking for? Is this the place for which i drive around 700kms in 2 days? ðŸ˜•"

First impression is the last impression, right? Or is it?

In the next article, lets talk about why Kanyakumari has one of the best beaches that I have ever seen and why it's people are so accommodating and friendly that they invited me over a family dinner.
