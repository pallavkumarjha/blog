Hi! My name is Pallav.

I recently completed a two months long ride on west coast of India (Woop woop ðŸ¥³). This article and the coming few articles will be my diary entry for the past two months, so please treat it like one.

I will try to be as descriptive as possible and if you have any comments, questions, doubts, complaints, appreciation or anything else, do leave a comment below or ping me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com).

This is the first article in a series about my journey. You can follow the series here:

## 1. The Genesis

The first thought of me going on a long bike ride occurred to me when I had to change cities (Noida to Bengaluru). I planned the entire route, where I would stop, which route to follow, what places to visit and what not.

Guess what, the plan went down the drain because of third wave of covid. I had to take a flight and change cities. Next thing I know I got covid. After recovering from it, the only thing I wanted to do was get on my bike and ride to some place. I had never done long rides (+350km) in the past so I wanted to test my stamina.

## 2. Testing the Waters

I took my bike next weekend and went on a long ride. It was a tiring day but I was able to manage somewhere close to 420km.

I had severe back pain, my whole body just wanted to rest. But damn what a ride it was.

Next thing I know I was planning to go to Pondicherry, and figuring out where to stay, what to eat, what to see and other things.

I had almost finalised everything and then I thought if I can do a week I can probably do a month, so why not plan for that. From there I started planning for this long ride.

## 3. The Parent Challenge

I knew that I could take on this challenge because I had some experience of solo budget traveling, so I had to address other challenges. First and foremost was getting permission from parents.

I could handle my expenses, I could take care of myself, I could live by myself but getting the permission to do that was a tough task.

Here are few things I kept in mind while solving this issue:

### 1. Address My Parents' Concerns

I need to understand if my parents are saying something, they have a reasonably good reason in their head on why they are saying it. I have to address it.

### 2. Build Trust Through Action

Show them, don't tell them. Action speaks louder than words. I went for a short trip, came back safely. Did the trip responsibly. Behaved like an adult. Shared my location with them, stayed in contact almost every time. Made them believe that I know what I am doing.

### 3. Financial Independence

This goes without saying. I want to do a trip, I want to go on a bike ride, I want to do that trek, so it should be My money which should be spent.

### 4. Embracing Adulthood

I am an adult. My parents have to understand that, and I have to understand that. I have to be responsible for my decisions and cannot put it on my parents that they took this decision for me. Once my parents realise this, they would know how important this trip is to me.

Read that line again.

## 4. What's Next?

In the next article, I would write about how I actually planned this long ride in budget.
