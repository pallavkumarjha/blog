This article continues my exploration of Kanyakumari, following my [previous post](/blog/exploring-kanyakumari) about initial impressions and discovering hidden spots.

## A Balanced Routine

To explore all the destinations I mentioned earlier, I devised a meticulous schedule. Despite maintaining my regular work commitments, I crafted a strategy to make the most of my time in this captivating town.

My weekday routine looked like this:
- 4:30 AM: Wake up and complete morning rituals
- 5:00 AM: Set off on my bike for morning exploration
- Return to accommodation for work
- 5:00 PM: Conclude work and head out again
- 9:00 PM: Return after dinner
- 9:30 PM: Settle in for the night

For two months, I maintained this disciplined schedule, successfully balancing my travel aspirations with professional responsibilities.

## Hidden Beaches and Landmarks

### Vattakotai Beach
My morning visit revealed an area adorned with abundant moss. Despite the language barrier, I had amusing interactions with local teenagers through sign language. The beach's charm lay in its simplicity - accessible via a road just before the fort, with a clear signboard guiding visitors to a 500-meter off-road trail.

### Chothavilai Beach
This exquisite, secluded beach offered breathtaking sunrises along its tranquil shoreline. The morning hours were particularly special, with near-complete solitude making it a perfect spot for peaceful contemplation.

### Lemur Beach
Slightly more popular than the others, Lemur Beach maintained its natural charm while offering exceptional sunrise views. Well-maintained roads lined with graceful palm trees made the journey as pleasant as the destination itself.

### Mathoor Aqueduct
Though activities were limited, this scenic spot provided a perfect setting for relaxation and appreciation of the landscape. While there weren't many shops, a few stalls offered refreshments to visitors.

### Other Notable Places
- Padmanabhapuram Palace (Closed during my visit due to elections)
- Tirparappu Water Falls (Very crowded, brief visit)
- Thiruvalluvar Statue and Vivekananda Memorial (Worth visiting, especially the meditation chamber)

## Capeista Café: A Home Away from Home

Located on the main beach road, Capeista Café became my regular haunt. Initially assuming it would be expensive, I was pleasantly surprised by its reasonable prices.

My regular order became lemon tea, accompanied by barbecued paneer - a special menu addition made just for me as a vegetarian option. Vijay, the café owner, went above and beyond by setting up a dedicated workspace when I asked about working there during daytime.

### Unexpected Connections

At the café, I met Thenba, who became my Instagram mentor. Over 2-3 days, he patiently taught me about the platform's significance and functionality. His guidance was invaluable, and I'd be happy to share his contact information with anyone interested in learning more.

On my last day in Kanyakumari, we all shared a memorable dinner together, marking the end of my week-long stay in this remarkable town.
