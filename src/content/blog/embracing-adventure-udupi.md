## The Journey Begins

After spending 3 days in Mangalore, I was a little bit bored. My vibe was not matching with the city, and I decided to shift. I packed my luggage and tied it on my bike, headed towards Udupi. I had only heard its name when masala dosa was mentioned, and I was curious to see what the town would offer. I was back on NH66.

Udupi is 60km from Mangalore, and on the way, I stopped at a local shop to have my breakfast. There was a fluffy bread on the counter, and I asked what it was. He said "Mangalore bun." I was surprised why I didn't find it in Mangalore. It was a little bit sweet. I had masala dosa with it as well.

## The Unexpected Turn of Events

You know how sometimes life throws you a curveball? Well, mine came in the form of a local scooty that decided to make my back its new best friend. Yup, you heard that right! As I was cruising along, wham! A scooter hit me from behind. No major injuries, just a broken left side indicator that I think I'll have to fix later.

What really warmed my heart were the locals rushing to my aid. "Hey, are you alright?" they asked. The vibe was super supportive, but then came the unexpected part — they wanted a little cash, like 500 bucks! Sorry, friends, not today. Just a bit too rich for my broke traveler's budget!

## Settling In: A Cozy Dorm Experience

After that little mishap, I needed a place to crash and recharge. I found a cozy dorm for just 300 rupees a night. The best part? For the first three nights, I had the whole room to myself! It was spacious with lots of beds (mostly empty, might I add), and I even discovered clothes drying on the roof. A perfect traveler's lair.

The only downside was the shared bathroom, but hey, we're roughing it, right? Plus, the wifi was decent, so I could go online and share my experience with you lovely people!

## A Moment of Reflection

Let's get real for a second. After the accident, I was shaken and considered packing my bags for Bengaluru. Fear had crept in, whispering that maybe this trip wasn't meant to be. But after some quiet soul-searching during a sea walk in Udupi, I had an epiphany! I thought, "What am I doing? This is my adventure!" So, I pledged to keep riding on this wave of exploration, and boy, am I glad I did.

Every evening, I returned to that same spot to watch the glorious sunset. The skies were painted in hues of orange and pink, and I was officially in love with Udupi.

## New Friends and Food Adventures

As luck would have it, my dorm-mate Mayank arrived on the fourth night. He was a YouTuber making videos about travel. Watching him casually chat with his camera felt oddly surreal for me, but we hit it off instantly! We explored the local flavours over a delightful meal at Pai Restaurant — definitely a must-try if you're ever in the area!

And guess what? You can catch me in one of his videos! So, make sure to check that out and give his channel some love!

## The Island Escape

The next highlight of my trip was a ferry ride to St. Mary's Island. For 400 rupees, I hopped on board, though I could've saved a few bucks if I'd waited a bit longer to catch a cheaper ride. But honestly, the adventure was worth it! The island was nothing short of breathtaking — hexagonal rocks, pristine waters, and shells instead of sand! Just be careful not to cut yourself on those little guys!

While there, I met Nitin, a super cool director from the Manipal group. He kept calling me "Raja," which cracked me up every time. Throw in a little luck when I almost lost my chappal to the waves (thank you, Nitin, for the rescue!), and the day turned into an unforgettable one.

Oh, and about that back ticket? Let's just say the sea gave it a suitable washing. Nitin, being the awesome guy he is, gave me his ticket to sneak back on the ferry. Who needs layers of bureaucracy when you have lovely travelers watching each other's backs?

## Closing Off in Style

Before I wrapped up my Udupi chapter, I checked out the Shri Hari Kala Museum, which had recently been renovated. For 300 rupees, it was another window into local culture. If you find yourself in Udupi, it's worth a visit!

As my time in Udupi came to an end, I knew I was ready for my next adventure: Gokarna! I felt rejuvenated, with memories and friendships that will last a lifetime.
