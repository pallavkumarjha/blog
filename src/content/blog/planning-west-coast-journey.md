This article is a continuation of my previous post about embarking on a solo motorcycle journey along India's west coast. If you're unfamiliar with my background, I recommend checking out the previous article first.

## Financial Planning

After securing permission and ensuring I had a capable bike, the next step was financial planning. I calculated a daily budget of ₹1000, excluding fuel costs. Here's how I broke it down:

- Accommodation: ₹500-₹600
- Food: ₹300-₹400
- Miscellaneous: ₹100-₹200

I added a buffer of ₹200 per day for unexpected expenses. For the two-month journey, the total budget came to less than ₹1,00,000 including fuel costs. I set aside ₹1,20,000 as a worst-case scenario fund to cover potential bike breakdowns or emergencies.

## 1. Introduction

This article is part of my West Coast Journey series. You can follow the complete series here:

4. [Ride to the Starting Point: Madurai to Kanyakumari](/blog/ride-to-starting-point)

## 2. Route Planning

For the west coast route, I planned to start from Kanyakumari and head north. Here's my planned itinerary:

1. Bengaluru (Start)
2. Madurai (1 night)
3. Kanyakumari (1 week)
4. Kochi (1 week)
5. Mangalore (3 days)
6. Udupi (4 days)
7. Gokarna (1 week)
8. Pune (1 week)
9. Mumbai (1 week)
10. Surat (4 days)
11. Mumbai (3 days)
12. Goa (1 week)
13. Bengaluru (End)

Since I needed to continue working during my journey, I planned most of my travel for weekends, particularly Sundays, with occasional weekday rides when necessary.

## Preparation and Packing

To prepare for the journey, I:
- Got my bike (Bosco) fully serviced
- Invested in essential riding gear:
  - New helmet
  - Riding gloves
  - Riding jacket
  - Riding pants

I'm a light traveler by nature, and motorcycle travel demands even more minimalism. I packed only the absolute essentials:

- A rucksack containing:
  - Clothes
  - Shoes
  - Slippers
  - Raincoat
- A laptop bag with:
  - Laptop
  - Chargers
  - Extension cord
  - Headphones

All luggage was secured to the bike using bungee cords, and with that, I was ready to begin my adventure.

Stay tuned for the next article where I'll share the experiences from day one of this incredible journey.
