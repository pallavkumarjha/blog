It happened on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I was sitting in my little home library, feeling kind of "blah" and looking for something to lift my spirits. As I scanned my shelves, something struck me – where had all my fiction gone? Somehow, over the years, my collection had transformed into shelves dominated by self-help, business, and personal development books. The colorful novels that once transported me to different worlds had been quietly replaced by practical guides promising to improve my productivity and life skills.

That moment sparked a journey back to fiction – one that I'm excited to share with you.

## When Did We Grow Out of Stories?

Remember how as kids, we'd beg for "just one more story" before bedtime? There was something magical about diving into worlds where animals could talk, ordinary children discovered extraordinary powers, and impossible adventures unfolded page by page.

Somewhere along the way, many of us – myself included – made the shift. Fiction started feeling like an indulgence, a distraction from "real learning." Non-fiction promised concrete benefits: career advancement, life improvement, practical skills. Fiction? Well, that was just... entertainment.

But here's what I've rediscovered: fiction isn't just entertainment. It might be one of the most important tools we have for developing empathy, creativity, and emotional intelligence.

## What Fiction Does to Our Brains

When researchers at Emory University studied the brain activity of people reading fiction, they discovered something fascinating. The neural changes weren't just happening while people read – they persisted for days afterward. When we immerse ourselves in a story, our brains create the same patterns as if we were experiencing those events ourselves.

Simply put: fiction literally changes our brains.

Reading stories about characters from different backgrounds helps us understand perspectives we might never encounter in our daily lives. A 2013 study published in Science found that reading literary fiction temporarily enhances our ability to understand other people's mental states – a crucial skill called "theory of mind" that's essential for complex social relationships.

## The Indian Connection

Growing up in India, stories were everywhere – from grandparents' tales during power cuts to mythological epics that shaped our cultural understanding. Indian fiction offers something uniquely powerful – the chance to see our own experiences, struggles, and joys reflected back at us.

When I read Amish Tripathi's Shiva Trilogy, it wasn't just an exciting reimagining of mythology – it was a bridge connecting ancient traditions with modern sensibilities. The way Tripathi humanized gods and created an alternative historical narrative made me see our cultural stories in a completely new light. Similarly, Premchand's "Pratigya" opened my eyes to social realities of pre-independence India with a directness that history books rarely achieve.

And it wasn't just Indian authors – Dan Brown's "The Lost Symbol" showed me how fiction can wrap complex ideas about science, history, and philosophy into a page-turning adventure. These books weren't just entertainment; they were gateways to different ways of thinking.

## "But Fiction Is Just Made-Up Stuff"

I used to think this too. If I wanted to learn, surely I should read true things, right?

What I've come to realize is that fiction often contains deeper truths than non-fiction. Through metaphor, character, and narrative, fiction helps us process complex emotional realities that straightforward explanations can't capture.

Think about it – which teaches us more about human nature: a psychology textbook explaining theoretical frameworks, or Premchand's characters navigating moral dilemmas that still feel relevant a century later? Which helps us understand belief systems better: a comparative religion course, or seeing how Amish Tripathi reimagines divine figures as humans dealing with extraordinary challenges?

## Finding Balance in Your Reading Diet

Now I see that both fiction and non-fiction deserve places in our libraries and reading time. They nourish different parts of our minds and hearts:

- **Non-fiction** gives us information, frameworks, and explicit knowledge
- **Fiction** develops our empathy, emotional intelligence, and helps us process complex human experiences

Like a balanced diet needs both proteins and carbohydrates, a balanced reading life needs both types of books.

## My Journey Back to Fiction

My return to fiction started with revisiting old favorites – the books that had once captured my imagination. The Shiva Trilogy reminded me how mythology could be reimagined in ways that feel fresh and relevant. Premchand's social realism showed me that fiction written decades ago can still offer insights into human nature that feel timeless.

I realized that during my years of focusing on self-improvement and professional development books, I'd been missing this unique form of wisdom. While non-fiction told me what to think, fiction was teaching me how to think – and more importantly, how to feel.

## Five Fiction Books That Shaped My Perspective

If you're looking to rediscover fiction, here are five novels that have had a profound impact:

1. **"The Shiva Trilogy" by Amish Tripathi** – A creative reimagining of Indian mythology that makes ancient stories feel fresh and relevant to contemporary life.

2. **"Pratigya" by Premchand** – A classic that addresses social issues with a clarity and humanity that still resonates today.

3. **"The Lost Symbol" by Dan Brown** – An adventure that weaves history, science, and philosophy into a compelling narrative.

4. **"Vikramaditya Veergatha" by Shatrujeet Nath** – An epic fantasy series that brilliantly reimagines the legendary king Vikramaditya's adventures with rich world-building and captivating storytelling.

5. **"Bahut Door Kitni Door Hota Hai" by Manav Kaul** – A collection of beautiful, contemplative stories that explore distance in its many forms – physical, emotional, and metaphorical.

## Where Do We Go From Here?

My bookshelves are slowly regaining balance. For every productivity book, I'm adding a novel. For every business strategy guide, a work of fiction that expands my understanding of the world in different ways.

I'm currently exploring more contemporary Indian authors and rediscovering classics I missed. My reading life feels richer, more colorful, and strangely, more practical too. The emotional intelligence I'm developing through fiction serves me in ways no how-to guide ever could.

So if your shelves have been taken over by practical guides promising self-improvement, maybe it's time to make space for stories again. Fiction isn't just an escape – it's a return to the most fundamentally human way of understanding ourselves and each other.

After all, long before we had self-help books, we had stories. Maybe they knew something we've forgotten.
