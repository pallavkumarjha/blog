## The Discovery

After my initial visit to Mangalore, I yearned to explore beyond the city limits. A quick Google search led me to Mulki, a quaint town that felt more like a secluded village. The place, I learned, was famous for three things: its surf school, kayaking opportunities, and the mysterious Bioluminescence beach (yes, I had to double-check that spelling!).

## Dawn Adventure

Deciding to try kayaking for the first time, I booked an early morning slot that would allow me to return in time for my office work. At 4:30 AM, while the world still slept, I set out on my 30km journey from my hotel. The route was refreshingly simple - just follow the main highway towards Udupi until you reach Mulki.

Arriving at the kayaking spot in darkness, I found myself alone in the pre-dawn stillness. A call to the manager confirmed my 6 AM slot, and being a weekday, I discovered I was the only booking. As I waited, the solitude was broken by a group of college students emerging from a nearby tent. Our conversation revealed they were there for a week-long Level 1 surf course - their enthusiasm for the waves was contagious.

## First Strokes

When my instructor arrived, he began with the basics - steering techniques, forward and reverse movements. Everything seemed straightforward in theory, but as I approached the single-person kayak, nervousness crept in. Not being a swimmer, the sight of the life jacket barely covering my chest did little to boost my confidence.

The kayak wobbled as I stepped in, sending a jolt of fear through me. Someone handed me the paddle, and with trembling hands, I took my first strokes. Gradually, as the kayak responded to my movements, confidence began to build. After twenty minutes, I found myself surprisingly comfortable, even daring to observe the jellyfish that occasionally drifted nearby (though the thought of capsizing quickly tempered my curiosity).

## Sunrise Stories

As the sun began its ascent, painting the sky in brilliant hues, I paused my paddling to take in the spectacle. My instructor, I learned, had an equally colorful story to share. Originally from Uttar Pradesh, he had followed his elder brother here in search of employment - a familiar tale of migration from tier-three cities in pursuit of opportunities to support family back home.

His monthly remittances to his parents filled him with pride, and as I sat in my anchored kayak, his story resonated deeply with the universal pursuit of better prospects and family devotion.

## Peaceful Waters

Three hours passed swiftly on the water, most spent in peaceful contemplation after anchoring in the middle of the sea. Despite the constant vigilance required to keep my phone safe in zipperless shorts, I managed to share the experience with family and friends through video calls - their amazement at the serene setting matching my own.

By 9 AM, I was back on land, heading straight to my trusty Bosco (my bike), racing against time to make it back to my hotel in Mangalore for the morning scrum call.

## A Hidden Gem

For anyone visiting Mangalore or Udupi, I strongly recommend taking a detour to Mulki. If you're seeking an escape from urban chaos or want to try kayaking for the first time, this hidden gem offers the perfect blend of adventure and tranquility.

That evening, finding Mangalore's entertainment options limited, I decided to continue my journey to Udupi the next day. The proximity meant I could easily reach there before my workday began, setting the stage for new adventures.
