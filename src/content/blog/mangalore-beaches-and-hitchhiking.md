## The Long Road to Mangalore

I was back on NH66 again, encountering those horrendous roads with an invisible divider and people racing as if they were in an F1 race. It was another long day. One thing I've noticed is that you'll want to cover as much distance as possible in the first half of the day before fatigue sets in. And it will set in. Your senses won't be as sharp as they were in the morning, you'll need frequent breaks, and constant sips of water. It's crucial to plan your rides carefully when you're riding for more than 8 hours.

## A Japanese-Style Stay

It was one of those unplanned days that was taking a toll on me, again. Somehow, I reached Mangalore late in the evening. I didn't even notice the time, but street vendors were closing their shops. I had booked my accommodation the night before. I wanted to skip the hostel; not that Mangalore had a lot of good options at that time, but I just wanted some me-time.

I booked a place called Bedspace for 500rs/day. I planned to stay here for 3 days and then change cities. When I entered my "accommodation," I was awestruck; it was a small (really small) and cozy place. It was a 6ft x 5ft cabin with no roof, and there were a total of 12 cabins with a common roof (I hope I am making sense). Each cabin had a bed, a TV, and space for luggage. Yes, all that in such a small space, and it was not uncomfortable. I felt like I was in Japan, in small homes. The guy running the place always wore a bandana as a mask on his face. He was an aspiring actor and showed me a few of his ventures on his phone. We had a good chat.

## Adventure to Bengre Beach

The next day, I followed the same ritual. I woke up around 4:30, went through my morning routine, and then set out. This time, I was heading towards Bengre main beach, which was far from the main city and required taking a ferry to reach there. I left my hotel around five in the morning and made my way to the ferry point.

Upon arrival, I had to park my bike and then board the ferry. Initially, I thought I could take my Royal Enfield on it, as I did in Kochi, but it wasn't allowed here. The ferry cost me 10rs and was used by locals as well to cross the water.

## The Art of Hitchhiking

When I reached the other side, I had no mode of transport, so I resorted to my old method of transportation: asking for lifts from strangers. Almost every time, I received help — not just once, but every time. I recall a time when I was traveling to Nainital with a friend. We asked for lifts and received it five times from different vehicles (jeeps, tractors, cars, etc.). It is one of my core memories.

Returning to the present, someone on a bike gave me a lift. He dropped me off at the beach and then turned around, coming just to drop me. (Humans are just awesome.) I arrived in time for my morning sunrise. It is a small, secluded beach. I crossed a few rocks to reach the beach on the far left. The land was polluted with plastic, but the water was good.

There was a fisherman there catching fish, and I joined him, although I wasn't much help.

## Morning Rituals and Work

On my way back, I had Masala dosa and Idli at a local joint and saw kids heading to school. It was heartwarming to see groups of kids excited about going to school.

I then began walking towards the pickup point for the ferry. Once again, I asked for help and received it. A kind person dropped me off where I needed to be. I purchased the ticket and boarded the ferry.

I reached my hotel around 9 AM and started my office work. I planned to finish early so I could head off early.

## Sunset at Surathkal Lighthouse

In the evening, I took my bike and headed towards Surathkal, which was a 30 km ride from Mangalore. The town is famous for its premier engineering institute, NIT Surathkal (National Institute of Technology).

I was planning to visit the famous Surathkal lighthouse. It was a fairly secluded place overlooking the Arabian sea.

I sat on a big rock and spent a couple of hours admiring the sunset. Because there was a college nearby, you could see a lot of students on the beach. It was nostalgic and took me back to my college days — how we could spend the entire day just talking to each other and not doing anything specific. While I didn't do anything particularly noteworthy during my college days, I still remember everything vividly. Looking back, I wouldn't change a single thing.

While exiting the parking area, my bike's wheel got stuck in the sand. I tried to push it, but being a 200kg machine, it didn't budge an inch. I revved the bike like crazy, and eventually, it moved from the ditch. However, in the process, my chain took a hit, resulting in a cranking sound. I planned to get it checked.

I reached my hotel around 9 in the evening after having dinner and went straight to sleep. It was a good day overall.

## Spiritual Journey at Murudeshwar

As my week in Gokarna neared its end, I visited the magnificent Murudeshwar Temple, with its towering Shiva statue overlooking the Arabian Sea. I happened to arrive during a local festival, when devotees gathered to sing bhajans that echoed across the waves. An elderly woman noticed my interest and spent an hour explaining the significance of each ritual, her eyes crinkling with joy at sharing her tradition.

## An Evening of Wisdom

On my final evening, Rahul invited me to join him for dinner after he finished selling kulfi for the day. "I want you to meet someone," he said mysteriously. That night, at a small family-run restaurant away from the tourist areas, he introduced me to an elderly baba who had been traveling the subcontinent for decades.

Over a meal of fresh paneer curry and rice, the baba shared wisdom gleaned from years on the road. "The difference between a tourist and a traveler," he told me as we shared our simple feast, "is that a tourist seeks places, but a traveler seeks insights." His words resonated deeply, encapsulating what made Gokarna special — not just its breathtaking landscapes, but the connections formed along the way.

## Farewell to the Coast

As I packed my bags the next morning, I realized that Gokarna had revealed itself to me gradually — not through itineraries or must-visit lists, but through moments of connection and solitude. From meditative mornings on empty beaches to philosophical conversations under starlit skies, each experience had woven itself into a tapestry of memories I would carry forward.

As the bike pulled away, I watched the coastline recede in the distance, carrying with me not just photographs of beautiful beaches, but the essence of Gokarna — its unhurried pace, its natural beauty, and most importantly, the genuine connections that transformed a simple beach vacation into a journey of discovery.
